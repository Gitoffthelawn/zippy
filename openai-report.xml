As the school has continued to grow, so has the number of teachers.\n\nBy the year 2009, Glacier Ridge had expanded to offer a preschool through 12th grade education, and the school had grown to almost 200 students. In the fall of 2013, the enrollment was over 300 students.\n\nThe school started with the first graduating class of 2002. They are now on their 11th graduating class, and the school's graduates continue to receive acceptance to universities across the United States. The school offers several Advanced Placement classes.\n\nGlacier Ridge has had its students participate in various competitions and competitions. Most notable are the sports teams, especially their basketball teams, which have qualified for state competition multiple times. The school has also had various music groups participate in state and regional competitions, and in the 2010-2011 school year, the school sent students to participate in an International Children's Games competition in Romania.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 school year, a group of the school's teachers were sent to Haiti to help establish a new orphanage, &quot;Eli's Children's House&quot;, which was dedicated to Eli Pierre, who had died in a motorcycle accident. They were instrumental in bringing the orphanage into the community by helping establish new programs for the children, including English as a Second Language, Computer Lab, and Physical Education classes. The teachers assisted in the education of the orphans as well as working with the staff on the property.\n\nThe school has also taken various trips over the years, including trips to Virginia and New York City. The school also hosted an educational trip to Washington D.C. for one of their graduating classes.\n\nThe school has participated in various community events and service projects. One of the most notable is their annual &quot;Twilight Prom&quot; that is held each spring. Each year, the school hosts a prom for local high school students who have special needs. The students' dates are typically their own siblings.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, a fire destroyed the school's auditorium, causing over $1 million in damages. After the school received an outpouring of support, the school was able to begin construction on a new auditorium in time for the next school year.\n\nIn 2015, Glacier Ridge Christian School became part of the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\nThe School is affiliated with the Association of Christian Schools International, the Ohio Christian Education Association, and the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\n]" time="0.291"><properties><property name="score" value="0.14449836" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Akyem Kotoku\n\nAkyem Kotoku is one of the five traditional districts of the Ashanti Empire.

People who reject God will die. The Bible says in Romans 1:32, &quot;Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.&quot; God says that those people who do these things deserve death, and yet people continue to do them and approve of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod will not tolerate the sinful acts of humanity, but He wants every person to be saved.

Let's say I have the following array of numbers:\n\nvar myNumbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\nThe following snippet of code would display the same numbers in reverse order:\n\nfor ( var i = myNumbers.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i-- ) { console.log( myNumbers[i] ); }\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nWe know that the index of an array can be used as a &quot;pointer&quot; to the location in memory that contains a particular item in an array. If the array myNumbers has five items, then myNumbers[0] , myNumbers[1] , myNumbers[2] , myNumbers[3] and myNumbers[4] will point to the values 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nIn the previous example, the code starts with the length of the array (5) and subtracts one from it. As we know that index 0 in an array contains the first item in the array, the previous code will execute the following steps:\n\nTake the length of the array (5) Subtract 1 (so we now have 4) Start at the index that contains the first item in the array (myNumbers[4] = 3) and run down the array until we reach the last item in the array (myNumbers[3] = 5)\n\nSo the above code will end up displaying the items in the array in reverse order, starting at index 4 and working backwards to index 0.\n\nAt this point, we have a good idea of how we can access the values in an array in a specific order, but how do we go the other way?\n\nIt would be great if we could simply use the same code as above, but add a &quot;--&quot; operator before the last number. That way, we could add a simple parameter to the code to control the range of numbers it will use.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't do that. While JavaScript will happily work with -- , it will also happily take -- in code and convert it to -1 , or the last number in an array. That's not going to do us any good, as we want the code to be flexible enough that we can work with a number that we specify as the range of numbers.\n\nSo let's look at a simple function that can give us the results we need.\n\nfunction rotate(numbers, direction, number) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push(number); numbers.unshift(number); };\n\nThe rotate function above has three parameters, and will rotate the values in the numbers array.\n\nnumbers is the array we want to use.\n\ndirection is the parameter that allows us to choose whether we want the values to be rotated in the direction we specify. In this case, we've chosen direction to be either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;\n\nnumber is the number we're using as the upper bound of the range that we want to use.\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\n\nAs we can see, the numbers array is simply rotated right by the number we specified. That's fine, but let's add in some code that we can use to control which numbers are displayed:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 1 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 4, 3, 5, 2 ]\n\nWe can see that we've rotated the numbers so that the first number in the array is now number 1 , and the next number in the array is 4 .\n\nWe've also specified that we want to rotate in a right-handed manner, by passing &quot;right&quot; as the second parameter. This means that we have access to the following rotation values:\n\nrotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; );\n\nIf we try to access the rotate function with &quot;left&quot; as the parameter, we'll see the following output:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nNot quite what we wanted, right?\n\nWhat we want is to be able to take an array, specify the number of numbers we want to display, and be able to choose the direction of rotation.\n\nWe also want to ensure that the values we are displaying are always within the array's bounds, and we're using them correctly.\n\nThe good news is that it's not too difficult to do this. We simply need to know what we want the code to look like, and write the code to do what we want it to do.\n\nLet's take a look at some simple code to display the numbers in an array in a given direction:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nrotateArray function\n\nThis is the code we'll use to display the numbers in the numbers array in the direction we specify. We'll start with a simple parameter:\n\nstartAt is the number we're displaying. It can either be the first number in the array, or any number within the array.\n\nLet's take a look at the code again:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing this simple function, we can take any number of numbers, and display them in the direction we want. Let's look at a quick example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;left&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nThis time, we've used &quot;left&quot; as the direction, and we've also used the parameter &quot;3&quot; as the startAt value. The result is that we now have the numbers displayed in the array starting at the number 3 .\n\nIf we use a number that isn't within the bounds of the array, we'll get the following result:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nAs you can see, the direction we've specified is &quot;right&quot;, and the value we've specified for startAt is 3 . Unfortunately, this value isn't within the bounds of the array, so the values in the array have been displayed starting from the last number in the array.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can use this code to work with a number that's outside the bounds of the array:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 6 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nThis time, we've specified &quot;right&quot; as the direction, and a value of 6 as the startAt parameter. The result is that we now have the values displayed in the array starting at the number 6 .\n\nThis time, the result we want is displayed in the array, but there's a problem. We don't want the number 6 to be the start of the array. Instead, we want it to be the last number in the array.\n\nThe good news is that we can easily handle this by modifying the code slightly:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing the simple rotation code above, we can now take any array, specify the number we want to display, and choose the direction we want to use. This means we can write some simple code that can work with any number, regardless of its position in the array.\n\nThe next step is to write some code that can ensure the number we specify as the startAt is in the range that we expect.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can do that:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { if( startAt &gt;= numbers.length ) { throw new RangeError(&quot;Start at is outside of the]" time="0.659"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0009482333" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Contents\n\n1.

The Commandments in the New Testament\n\n8. Tolerance\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Meaning of Love\n\nBefore we can love others, we must know the meaning of love. It is important to love God and obey Him and to have a right relationship with Him. But to have a right relationship with Him we must love Him. That means that we must have a good relationship with all His laws.\n\nOf course we can't keep all the commandments all the time. Yet we must have a good relationship with them. Otherwise we will not know what God is like.\n\nLove is based on God's law.\n\nRomans 13:10. The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nGalatians 5:14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nLove is based on God's law. We should study God's commandments and know the laws He has given us. Then we will know how to have a good relationship with Him.\n\nOne reason we are to love God and obey Him is that it is important to have a good relationship with God. We need to know how much God loves us. Without knowing this we cannot have a right relationship with God. We need to have a good relationship with Him so we can be happy and serve Him better.\n\nLet us understand what love is.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nIn these verses John explained that love is the opposite of lawlessness. Love is the opposite of murder, hatred, malice, evil, adultery, stealing, lying, and a lot of other bad things.\n\nRomans 13:8-10. Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law. For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\n\nWe learn from this that the opposite of love is lawlessness. The opposite of love is murder, hatred, envy, malice, evil, and all the other things mentioned in these verses.\n\nVerse 10 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; In other words, love is a good thing. It is a good thing to have a good relationship with God.\n\nRomans 13:8 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; Love helps and blesses others.\n\nLove is a good thing. The reason love is a good thing is because God is love.\n\n1 John 4:16. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love; and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man has seen God at any time.

Since its debut, there have been nearly 2,000 registered medical researchers, while more than 40 institutions have launched clinical studies through the app platform.\n\n\n\nBut there are several hurdles for Apple and its partners. On Wednesday, Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, will join at a panel discussion at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to examine what works and what\u2019s missing in the fast-evolving field of mobile health.\n\n\n\nThe session, titled \u201cWhat Are the Future Directions for ResearchKit?\u201d comes after a first wave of successful projects on ResearchKit, including apps that help people manage diabetes, heart disease and asthma.\n\n\n\nThere are also some examples of the problems Apple is facing as it tries to get more partners to adopt the tool. Earlier this month, a major player in the diabetes community said it would not be taking part in the app\u2019s data collection. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said in a statement that its members were not interested in the iPhone platform and \u201cwould prefer to conduct research studies using our own patient data that is gathered on an Android platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s likely an expensive prospect for the organization, given the popularity of iPhones in the United States. As of last year, Android devices accounted for just over half of all U.S. smartphone subscribers, while iOS devices made up around 41 percent. That\u2019s according to the Pew Research Center, which estimated last year that there were 121 million iPhone users in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe success of Apple\u2019s platform will hinge in part on how it handles data privacy and security concerns. Apple had to clear some hurdles in the early days of ResearchKit because many people were concerned about privacy when they heard it would rely on data from Apple\u2019s servers. Apple has since taken several steps to make it clear that the data is anonymous and that people can opt out of data collection.\n\n\n\nThe app program could also be a major part of the iPhone\u2019s future if it takes off. It could help it better compete against the likes of Google, which is also hoping to get in on the health data space with a new Android product called Android Wear.\n\n\n\nThe first public version of ResearchKit will be unveiled on Wednesday, the panel will also include representatives from Mount Sinai and Pfizer.\n\n\n\nThat event will be at 11:30 a.m. EDT in New York City, and it will be livestreamed on Fortune\u2019s website.]" time="0.301"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0012089905" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00120899&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00120899

Sometimes, the changes within the industry are so drastic that a superstar's popularity can get left in the past. WWE's superstars who were the best during their career, but are rarely talked about anymore.\n\nWWE is still the leader of the wrestling world. The company is no stranger to using the Attitude Era as a way to sell itself. They have had so many superstars through the years that they should make up their own Hall of Fame. Some of those superstars are the ones who are mentioned the most.\n\nThe casual fan knows about Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold, and The Rock. That is what makes this so fun. Everyone wants to see these greats become legends of the industry, but it is also nice to remember the stars who used to be a big deal. Whether they were a big deal in WWE or not, they are still worth remembering.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\n10 Sin Cara\n\nvia trbimg.com\n\nSin Cara has become a joke of a superstar. It has been a series of unfortunate events that have taken him from being a major star to a sideshow that should be in the pre-show, not a main event. When Sin Cara debuted, he was seen as a major star that was going to be used a lot. It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe problem was that he never delivered.\n\nHe was so unimpressive that he was booted from WWE in 2016. He is making an appearance at WrestleMania 33. For his sake, it would be best if he kept quiet and didn't interact with the crowd.\n\n9 Kelly Kelly\n\nvia tumblr.com\n\nKelly Kelly was a fan favorite during her time in WWE. She made her debut as a popular model who was wrestling on ECW. From there, she rose to the top as a valuable part of the roster. Kelly became a popular figure who had her own dedicated fans. She had the right amount of talent to be a decent worker, but it was her good looks that gave her the extra push.\n\nAfter leaving WWE in 2012, Kelly kept wrestling. She is back on the roster with TNA, but she has not appeared on a television episode of Impact Wrestling since December of 2015.\n\n8 Alberto Del Rio\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is a sad truth that Alberto Del Rio has fallen from his former position in the industry. He was a very big part of WWE. He was not only the United States Champion, but also a World Champion. Alberto had a unique presence as a superstar that could do things no one else could do. He also had the microphone skills to back up his moves.\n\nHis tenure in WWE was marred with incidents that made it clear he was not going to be there much longer. His time in Lucha Underground was more memorable, but it was a step down from what he used to be.\n\n7 The Great Khali\n\nvia cagesideseats.com\n\nThe Great Khali is not really a superstar that anyone really misses. His presence was laughable at times. The thing about Khali is that he had a lot of potential. He was very big and very strong, but he never seemed to have any clue about how to use those traits to his advantage.\n\nKhali is now an actor and a former wrestler. He is part of the reality show Khali Kisses, which involves him doing a lot of kisses on people. It is a far cry from his WWE days.\n\n6 Kelly Kelly's Boyfriend\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nWrestlers who are lucky enough to find a wife have a much easier time in the wrestling industry. The same could not be said for Mike Knox. He was only a superstar for a very short time, and he was a part of one of the most bizarre moments in wrestling history when he got the Attitude Adjustment from Kane. Knox is not talked about much these days, but there was a time when people were curious about him.\n\nHe married the popular WWE superstar Kelly Kelly. The couple got married in 2014. It was a marriage that was not meant to last, as the couple divorced in 2016.\n\n5 Santino Marella\n\nvia ringsidenews.com\n\nSantino Marella will forever be a part of WWE. The WWE Hall of Fame is home to some great wrestlers and some very bad wrestlers. Santino is among those who have made an impression for one reason or another. His career with the company was not as successful as he had hoped, but he made a huge impact. He was the guy who was hilarious because he was so bad.\n\nSantino's last match was in 2014. He has done some backstage work, but the star has pretty much disappeared from WWE.\n\n4 Tyson Kidd\n\nvia heavy.com\n\nTyson Kidd was a true performer in WWE. He had a unique look, and he could really do it all. The man was skilled on the mic, in the ring, and he had a good personality. Everything came together for Tyson, but that would all change during an unfortunate injury. Tyson was a mid-carder who could have risen to a top level, but that was not meant to be.\n\nKidd is now recovering from his neck injury. He is still hoping to get into the ring again, but it is looking unlikely.\n\n3 Christian\n\nvia bodybuilding.com\n\nChristian is not a name that is being mentioned much these days. It is a shame, as he is one of the best performers of his time. Christian has made a career of being known for his impressive in-ring work and his ability to entertain fans. Christian was a popular superstar during his time in WWE and he did some good things for TNA.\n\nChristian has not been in the ring since December of 2015. He is trying to get back into the ring, but there is a possibility that his neck injury may have ended his career.\n\n2 Dolph Ziggler\n\nvia wrestlingnewssource.com\n\nDolph Ziggler had the chance to become a very big star in WWE. Unfortunately, things have not been going well for Ziggler. He was once a main eventer, but he has fallen to the bottom of the card. He is one of the many guys who will be pushed as the underdog who is going to have the moment of their life.\n\nZiggler has not been the focus of WWE. It is likely that he will be entering a new chapter of his career in the near future. The most likely place would be in Ring of Honor, but WWE has shown a lot of interest in Ziggler.\n\n1 Wade Barrett\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the casual fan to remember Wade Barrett. He had a short run in WWE, but he did his part as a mid-carder. Barrett is a former Intercontinental Champion. He did well in WWE as a member of The Nexus, but his star power never quite took off.\n\nBarrett has been out of WWE since 2014. He has had some ups and downs in the independent circuit, but his career has largely gone downhill. It is possible that he could get another chance with WWE. That would probably be the only way that fans would get to see him again.\n\nBarrett has been trying to make a name for himself in the business world. He launched a website last year. It is not likely that he will become a success, but it is nice to see him try to make something of his life.]" time="0.615"><properties><property name="score" value="0.6548439269999999" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[The brother-in-law of the Palestinian-American teenager who was filmed being brutally beaten by Israeli police at a West Bank checkpoint says the incident \u201chas put a wedge\u201d between the Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nYoussef Almogy said he has had more than 50 phone calls from news media outlets following the brutal arrest of 16-year-old Tariq Abu Khdeir, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw it, I cried,\u201d Almogy said. \u201cI was so shocked, but after that, I started thinking about my brother, who was jailed for 11 years, and then released for nothing.

The partnership will see the creation of two exclusive, made-for-VR games from Bethesda Game Studios; the first is currently being designed for virtual reality and the second is being built for traditional monitors.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt Oculus, we\u2019re dedicated to helping developers and partners to grow, and the support and dedication we\u2019ve received from Bethesda Game Studios has been outstanding,\u201d said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus. \u201cJohn Carmack, founder of id Software and now CTO at Oculus, believes in our vision and has created a custom version of Doom 3 BFG Edition for Oculus. We look forward to continuing to work with Bethesda as we develop our first generation of virtual reality games and experiences.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a lot of personal interest in making sure that the VR gaming space is successful because I really believe in the technology and its potential to change gaming,\u201d said Carmack. \u201cAs a developer, the Rift is something that I\u2019ve wanted to work with for a long time, but the existing technology wasn\u2019t quite there yet. I\u2019m happy to be able to help to make the Rift a success and contribute to the rebirth of VR gaming.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt Bethesda Game Studios, developers are working on a number of unannounced projects including new entries in major franchises. Those who have seen this year\u2019s E3 show floor, Gamescom or Quakecon presentations have seen teases of what the studio is up to and a few of the titles we have in development are also being designed for virtual reality. The two games announced today are entirely new IP and we can\u2019t wait to show them to you when they\u2019re ready for primetime.\n\n\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Bethesda Game Studios, the acclaimed developer is responsible for creating many of the industry\u2019s most popular games including the \u201cElder Scrolls\u201d series, the single-player add-on to the original \u201cDoom\u201d and the \u201cFallout\u201d series.

So, how have you all been doing?\n\nToday, I have a special post. I know most of you do not know but it is the 'World Animal Day'. The day is celebrated worldwide on October 4 to create awareness of animal rights and welfare. The day is a very special one for me because I am a vegetarian, animal lover and a dog-person.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the last one year, I have been trying to spread the awareness among the people. I have been trying to encourage people to stop using animals as fur coats, cosmetics and for food. I want people to know the feelings of these animals, the pains they suffer and what they go through while they are alive. Also, the environmental damage they cause to the planet. It is very important to spread this message because animals are treated as if they are some sort of toys that we can play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, I would like to share with you some tips on how we can help the animals and make the planet a better place to live. I also have a small personal pledge to make. Also, if you have not signed the pledge yet, you can also make your own pledge to protect the animals and the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips and pledges to help the animals\n\n(made by my friend!)\n\nOne way we can make a change is by making an effort to not use cosmetics that are tested on animals. We can choose to use all cruelty free products and make a conscious effort not to use anything that has been tested on animals.\n\nWays to reduce our carbon footprints and help protect the environment:\n\nAvoid eating meat, or even better, go vegetarian (dairy, eggs are not vegan but I still encourage you to stop using dairy products as well)\n\nUse eco-friendly products - Not just cosmetics but also in our everyday lives.\n\nGo cruelty free - Choose cruelty free products and wear clothes that have not been made out of leather, fur or wool.\n\nStop buying those animals that we do not need. Also, choose to buy second hand or recycled clothes. Avoid buying pets if you cannot provide the proper care for them.\n\nAdopt, don't buy! You can adopt a dog or cat from an animal shelter. Do not buy animals from pet stores or breeders. They are sold to you as &quot;breed-free&quot; animals but most of them have been bred in horrible conditions. Also, make sure you know the sex of the animal you are getting, because they usually are sold as 'un-neutered' or 'un-spayed' animals.\n\nMake a conscious effort to not use plastic bags. Use reusable bags or better still, try to avoid using bags at all.\n\nTry to use products that do not harm the environment and are biodegradable.\n\nWays to help the animals:\n\nSign the pledge - To show that you support the cause to protect the animals.\n\nShare the post - Let others know of the cruelty that the animals go through. Let them know how they can help the animals too.\n\nJoin or start a protest or campaign to help the animals.\n\nThe small pledge I am making is to help the animals. Every month, I will be donating some money to an animal shelter in my town to help feed the dogs and cats there.\n\nThese are just some of the ways we can help the animals and the planet. We can all make a change, and make this planet a better place to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know how to become a vegan, and which cosmetics are tested on animals, you can read this post: How to be a vegan?\n\nRemember, we are what we eat, so be what you want to be.

Roots can become entangled in the small cracks between the asphalt and the cement to create the impression that the tree is growing out of the road! And when the roots do become entwined, the pressure can be so great that the roots are destroyed. We all know the danger this creates for the trees.\n\nThe solution to this problem is obvious: pave over the whole road surface. Not so fast! In the City of Chicago, for example, there is a practice that preserves the utility of the tree\u2019s roots and of the road surface itself. The practice is called \u201cmilling\u201d. Milling involves cutting the asphalt out in a shape that will not disturb the roots and adding back in a new surface. While the tree is protected, the roots are not disturbed and the road surface is left intact. When a tree is scheduled for removal, this is often the method of choice. Milling also involves improving the root zone around the tree. The roots of many trees can\u2019t penetrate the compacted soil that is found beneath pavement, so it is necessary to mill the area to promote root growth.\n\nMilling is less expensive than paving over a road surface and can also be less expensive than removal of a tree. Milling should be done whenever possible and certainly before a tree is scheduled for removal.

While the list included major agricultural producers such as Brazil and Canada, U.S. meat producers were noticeably absent. However, on Wednesday, the government added the U.S. to the list of banned meat importers.\n\nThe ban was announced by the state consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. A government official told Russian media that American meat imports were now being kept out of Russia on a \u201ctemporary basis\u201d.\n\nRussia is the fourth largest importer of U.S. meat, buying $51 million worth of poultry and $22 million of pork in 2016. According to the National Pork Producers Council, the U.S. shipped 27,600 metric tons of pork to Russia in 2016, which made up 0.3 percent of total U.S. pork exports.\n\nRead more: Polls Say Few Americans Think Trump is Putin's Puppet\n\nThe ban comes at a particularly difficult time for the U.S. meat industry, which is still struggling to recover from a disastrous salmonella outbreak that began in 2015.

The outbreak, which resulted in more than 60 percent of pork being recalled, was linked to at least 184 illnesses in 20 states. While U.S. authorities traced the outbreak back to a farm in Missouri, they were unable to identify the exact source of contamination.\n\n\u201cThis has been a major setback for us and it will take a while for the industry to recover,\u201d said National Pork Producers Council spokesman Dave Warner.\n\nIt's not clear when Russia will lift its ban on U.S. meat, but Russia's state consumer protection watchdog has said it would allow Ukrainian meat imports.]" time="0.300"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0025902723" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00259027&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00259027

For some, the reason is because they still have some of their shopping list to complete. Others, however, have an entirely different reason.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian adult will spend $473.12 on gifts this holiday season. That means the average consumer will spend almost $35 more this year than last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of consumers have gone overboard,\u201d says Ted Michalos, founder of CMG Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the spending that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s what they\u2019re spending the money on.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because many shoppers are buying gifts for themselves. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re spending on the latest fashions, but rather toys and electronics. And the majority of these gifts, at 41.8 per cent, are going to be purchased online.\n\nHowever, the reason why so many people are spending online is because they\u2019re trying to avoid the crowds and waiting in lines.\n\n\u201cSome consumers just get too stressed and they go online to get their stuff,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd if they do that, they\u2019re likely going to be paying more for the gifts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because while there are fewer people at the store, they\u2019re paying more per person. For example, if someone is paying $50 for a gift in the store, they\u2019re likely to pay more than $50 online.\n\n\u201cThis is really the time where you\u2019re going to have to do your best to have everything done by the 15th,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd it\u2019s definitely a good idea to sit down with your spouse or significant other and look at your budget. And when you have a child, the best thing to do is to write down what you\u2019re going to spend. That\u2019s a real good thing to do, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll overspend.\u201d\n\nAnd that could come with consequences, because if you\u2019re overspending, you could be limiting your ability to spend on your children or other family members in the future.\n\n\u201cYou can go overboard and give away everything you have to your kids and that could be a problem,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cThis could be an opportunity to teach your kids about moderation, and also the difference between \u2018I want\u2019 and \u2018I need.\u2019\u201d\n\nBecause with Christmas, most people are shopping with the mindset of \u2018I want,\u2019 not \u2018I need.\u2019 And that can be a problem, because it will prevent you from saving or investing.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be shopping on a credit card, you\u2019re going to be in big trouble,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cIf you\u2019re not able to pay off that debt by the end of January, you\u2019re going to be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nWant to know more about debt?

The context is the central part of the SharePoint client object model, and it\u2019s available from any client, including SharePoint-hosted, remote, or SharePoint-hosted-remote applications.\n\nTo create a SharePointContext object, you call the SharePointContext.GetContextAsync() method and pass in a SharePointContextOptions object. The SharePointContextOptions object provides the user information and authentication settings. We\u2019ll dive into the details in the \u201cAuthorization\u201d section of this article.\n\nOnce you have your context, you can then call methods on it. The context has a number of methods on it to retrieve different information.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the available methods:\n\nGetContextAsync() - The method that is used to create the context.\n\n\n\n- The method that is used to create the context. SharePointContextPermission - The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user. SharePointPermissions - The property that contains the current permission level of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current permission level of the user. ListPermissions - The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists. SPHostUrl - The property that contains the URL of the current host application.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the URL of the current host application. Site - The property that contains the current site of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current site of the user. UserPrincipalName - The property that contains the username of the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the username of the current user. Web - The property that contains the current web of the user.\n\n\n\nSPUtility\n\nThe SPUtility class provides static methods to retrieve a SharePoint context and return it. To get the context, you call the SPUtility.GetSharePointContext() method.\n\nThe methods you have available on the SPUtility.SharePointContext object are:\n\nClientContext\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\nGetClientContext()\n\n\n\nGetWeb()\n\n\n\nSharePointContext Permission\n\nBefore we dive into the SharePoint context, let\u2019s talk about permission. The SharePoint context is going to be pretty useless without a permission token. We\u2019re going to talk about this permission token a lot in this article, so let\u2019s just take a quick look at how it\u2019s generated.\n\nWe\u2019ll need to use the SharePoint permissions provider to generate the token. To do so, you\u2019ll need to call the SharePointPermissionManager.GetPermissionsAsync() method. You\u2019ll need to pass in an instance of the site where you want the permissions for.\n\nIn this example, we\u2019re going to call GetPermissionsAsync() and get the current user\u2019s permissions.\n\nGetPermissionsAsync() returns a SharePointPermissions object, which you can use to set your permissions on lists, folders, and documents. The SharePoint permissions are applied in a single pass. This means that you can\u2019t apply different permissions to different entities. For example, if you want to apply permissions on the web, the site, and the lists and folders, you\u2019ll need to pass in the permission on the web, then on the site, then on the lists and folders. You can, however, pass in different permissions to different lists and folders.\n\nOne other thing to note about SharePoint permissions is that they only grant access to the web, not to the list or to the folder itself.\n\nFor example, if a user doesn\u2019t have the Edit permission to a list, he will still be able to view it. But if the user has the Edit permission to the list, he will be able to edit it.\n\nIf you want to deny access to the whole list, you can set the permissions for the list and all its subfolders to Deny.\n\nIn order to create the context, we\u2019ll use the context, the SharePoint permissions provider, and a helper class, which we\u2019ll talk about later in the article. The full example is shown in Listing 1.\n\nThe context object will now be passed to the constructor of a class called FileRootsProvider. The FileRootsProvider class is part of a helper class that I wrote and will be available to you in this article.\n\nThe provider will be created with the context and then called to generate the access token. Once the access token is generated, it will be returned to us, and we can start to retrieve information about the site and its lists and folders.\n\nAccess Token\n\nWhen you call the SharePoint permissions provider, you\u2019ll receive a token that represents the permissions for the current user. The token is returned as a SharePointPermissions object, which is what we\u2019ll use to apply the permissions.\n\nTo create a SharePointPermissions object, you need to pass in the site URL where the permissions should apply. For our example, we\u2019ll pass in the site URL to the SharePointPermissions constructor.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve created the permissions, you can apply them to the lists and folders. You can do this by passing in an instance of a list or folder to the SharePointPermissions constructor. If you want to apply permissions to all lists and folders, you can simply pass in an empty list or folder.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve created the permissions, we can use the FileRootsProvider class to generate the access token. The access token is returned as a SharePointContextPermissions object. The SharePointContextPermissions object contains the permission token and other details that we\u2019ll use to get information from the SharePoint site.\n\nAs you can see, the code to get the access token is pretty straightforward. The example is shown in Listing 2.\n\nList\n\nGetting the access token isn\u2019t all you need to do. You also need to be able to get a list and get a list item. To do this, you\u2019ll need to call the SharePointContext.GetListAsync() method. The method is easy to use and returns a list object.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a specific list, you can pass in the list GUID or the URL of the list. Listing 3 shows an example of both the URL and GUID to get the lists from.\n\nItems\n\nThe code to get an item from a list is just as easy as getting the list. You can pass in the list item GUID to the GetListItemAsync() method. Listing 4 shows an example of how to get the list item with the GUID.\n\nSummary\n\nThis article was a quick look at how to get a SharePoint context. The examples used a helper class that I created to make it a little easier to get access to lists and items from SharePoint.]" time="0.622"><properties><property name="score" value="0.14727592" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[A few months back, I wrote an article about the journey from yearning to prayer.

There is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. This paper exploits the introduction of minimum attainment targets in the National Curriculum for schools to explore the impact of early education policies on students\u2019 achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nData and methods\n\nAnalysis\n\nDiscussion\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nUniversity participation in the UK has grown substantially since the early 1990s. There are now 1.4 million undergraduates, which is almost double the number in 1992. However, participation rates have remained relatively low among those from lower socioeconomic groups (Furlong and Millar, 2008). For example, 40 per cent of young adults from high-income backgrounds were participating in higher education in 2011-12, compared to 21 per cent from the poorest fifth of families.\n\nTo some extent, low participation among young people from less advantaged backgrounds is to be expected given the historical association of university education with privileged groups. Participation rates increased significantly in the 1960s, after state support for university was extended to less affluent groups. Participation rose further during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, but then stagnated in the 1990s and declined slightly after 2002. Only in the past decade has participation among the less well-off again risen to the levels recorded in the early 1990s (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. University participation rates by parental income, 1962-2012\n\nNote: Figures are cohort entry rates for those who went to university in each year. Sources: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2014); Sutton Trust/Ipsos Mori (2012); Education Policy Institute (2013).\n\nDespite increased participation, the gap in participation rates between young people from more and less advantaged backgrounds is still large, even after controlling for qualifications. On average, young people from the most advantaged fifth of families are about twice as likely to go to university as those from the least advantaged fifth (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Proportion of young people who go to university by family income, 1996-2012\n\nSource: Participation rates (log scale) are from the UCAS End of Cycle Reports, 1996-2012. The relative income quintiles are from the Family Resources Survey, 2008-2012. The quintiles have been adjusted to allow for comparison across years by using a fixed poverty line.\n\nAt a recent seminar organised by the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy, Professor Martin Brown (2012) suggested that it is \u2018a great mystery why this gap is not widening even more\u2019. He also pointed out that there is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. It is well-known that, in addition to their socio-economic background, non-cognitive skills, such as motivation, are important predictors of academic achievement. Since the increase in university participation has been driven by the growth in participation of less advantaged groups, it is not surprising that it has also been associated with a fall in the average grades of university entrants.\n\nThis paper is motivated by this observation, that early education policies have played an important role in the increase in participation among less advantaged groups. We focus on two such policies: the requirement to meet minimum attainment targets in English, mathematics and science, and the national literacy and numeracy strategies. We explore the impact of these policies on students\u2019 achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees. We also find that the increase in the A-level scores and the higher participation rate associated with the introduction of minimum attainment targets cannot be explained by the improvement in the overall level of academic performance in schools or by the lower socioeconomic status of those schools that introduced minimum attainment targets.\n\nData and methods\n\nTo analyse the impact of minimum attainment targets, we use the school-level dataset that the Department for Education makes available annually for the National Pupil Database (NPD). The NPD contains rich information about individual pupils and their schools. We first use the NPD to examine the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education by using cohort-level information on final examinations. We then explore the impact of minimum attainment targets using changes in the composition of achievement. The results we present in this paper are robust to the alternative methods of analysis of achievement levels and changes in the composition of achievement.\n\nIn the first stage of our analysis, we explore the evolution of the A-level examination results by using the cohort-level information on final examinations. To study the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education, we use the data on A-level grades in GCSE and A-level examinations from 1996 to 2012. In this period, the examinations have changed significantly, from the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and the A-level examinations. The A-level examination was first introduced in the early 1950s as an academically rigorous alternative to the less selective B-level examinations (Wynne, 2010). Until 1988, A-level grades (i.e. O/A levels) were assigned by teachers, not by the students. From 1988, the responsibility for grading moved to schools. The examination was revised in the early 1990s, after which it was separated into two components: A-level and AS-level. The A-level examinations were re-structured in 2000. Most importantly, the exams have become linear rather than modular. The exams in each subject are now taken at the end of the two-year course. The exams are now externally assessed, and the grade is assigned according to the nationally defined A-level grade boundaries. The percentage of the cohort that sat the A-level examinations increased from about two-thirds in the early 1990s to more than 90 per cent in the mid-2000s. This reflects a policy shift in the assessment of vocational qualifications, which reduced the proportion of vocational qualifications that counted towards a student\u2019s A-level grade.\n\nWe use a slightly modified version of the grading system developed by Hayward, Parry and Stewart (2009) and Bias et al. (2011). We use a scale of 5 grades to assess the performance of students in different subjects: 5 is an \u2018A*\u2019 grade, 4 is an \u2018A\u2019 grade, 3 is a \u2018B\u2019 grade, 2 is a \u2018C\u2019 grade and 1 is a \u2018D\u2019 grade. The best possible grade in each subject is an \u2018A*\u2019. This grading system differs from the one used in most of the existing analyses of A-level results, which use an A-E grading system. The difference between the two grading systems is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that about 60 per cent of the students in the upper grade boundary of \u2018A*\u2019 under the old system would be below the upper boundary of \u2018A*\u2019 under the new system. Similarly, about 45 per cent of the students in the lower boundary of \u2018C\u2019 would be in the upper boundary of \u2018C\u2019 under the old system, and about 25 per cent of students in the lower boundary of \u2018C\u2019 would be in the upper boundary of \u2018C\u2019 under the new system. We expect that the increase in the A-level scores associated with the change in the grading system will be smaller for subjects that were not directly affected by the reform, such as English, maths and science. We do not analyse students\u2019 performance in the core and non-core subjects, because data on the subject of A-level examination was not available for every pupil.\n\nFigure 3. Grading scales of GCSE and A-level examinations\n\nIn Figure 4, we present the cumulative distribution of A-level scores for each cohort, by the subject studied. Figure 5 shows that the average A-level score increased from a little less than \u2018C\u2019 in 1996 to more than \u2018C\u2019 in 2012, which is consistent with the improvement in the average GCSE results. The gap in the average grades between different subjects remained stable. The increase in the average A-level grades was particularly large in science subjects and in humanities subjects. We do not find evidence of a widening gap in A-level scores between the richest and the poorest students. In the humanities subjects, there is some evidence of an increase in the A-level scores of the less well-off. However, the increase in the average A-level scores was so large that the difference in the average scores between the richest and the poorest students decreased even though it was not eliminated.\n\nFigure 4.

When George Henry Alcock (1864\u20131941), a climber and mountaineer, visited the Cuillin in 1893, he wrote in his book Through the Highlands and Islands of Scotland:\n\nNo one who had not seen the Black Cuillin and the peculiar forms which the rocks assume would believe that nature could assume such strange shapes as are seen here. The first view of the Cuillin from the south makes them look like a huge fortress of rock, with fantastic turrets and chimneys, and battlemented walls.\n\n\nToday these classic features, viewed from the slopes of the nearby mountains of the mainland, such as the Beinn Eighe and M\xf2ine Mh\xf2r, have hardly changed. But the Cuillin are not just aesthetically pleasing. To their first British explorers in the mid-nineteenth century, the Black Cuillin, which form a massive ridge running from Coire an Lochain in Glen Brittle to An Dubh Sgeir, seemed a forbidding mountain barrier, \u2018a fortress of rock\u2019. Their modern reputation, and that of the smaller range of the Red Cuillin to the south-east, as a major challenge to both rock climbers and mountaineers, was established during the second half of the twentieth century. However, despite the presence of the two main ridges on the Black Cuillin (North-West Ridge and Central Ridge), many individual peaks, and the climbing routes up them, were relatively unexplored. This was to change in the 1970s and 1980s when many of the hard, mixed and winter routes, most of which were first climbed in the Cuillin, were recorded by enthusiastic pioneers. Today, climbing and scrambling in the Cuillin can be combined with hillwalking, and the varied routes, combined with the varied weather of Skye, offer an extremely satisfying and testing experience for a mountaineer.\n\nIn writing this guidebook, I have had to make many decisions regarding what routes to describe, and which to omit. Many climbers may not agree with my choices, and it is inevitable that a guidebook such as this will not be comprehensive. As well as describing my chosen routes, I have tried to include a range of other interesting aspects of the Cuillin, in order to make the book relevant to anyone interested in a mountaineering trip to Skye.\n\nGeology\n\nThe geology of Skye, and especially the Cuillin, is fascinating, and as well as a number of peaks and ridges, it has given rise to a series of dramatic glens, the upper parts of which are in the Inaccessible Pinnacle (Coire nam Bian) to the north of the main ridge. The Black Cuillin consist of metamorphic rocks which were formed as a result of a major mountain-building event in the Caledonian Orogeny, the mountain-building event which took place between 500 and 400 million years ago. At this time, a number of folds (anticlines and synclines) were formed, some of which can be seen today. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr, for example, was the result of the raising up of a syncline (Fig. 1). This event also resulted in the granite being exposed to the surface, but this did not happen everywhere. To the east of the island, most of Skye is underlain by metamorphic rocks, but to the west, particularly on the western coast of the Trotternish peninsula, granite is exposed. The Blue Stack is also part of a major fold which has resulted in the formation of the Trotternish Ridge.\n\nFigure 1. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr.\n\n\nThese major events have also resulted in a relatively complex geological map, with three main rock types (Fig. 2). A general layer of granite, called the Inaccessible Pinnacle Quartz Diorite, extends from the Blue Stack north-eastwards to Beinn Eighe. This granite has been intruded by the Red Cuillin Granite, which has a different composition and thus has different characteristics to the underlying rock. In the central and eastern parts of the main ridge of the Black Cuillin, the rocks are composed of the Papcastle Gneiss, which is a granitic metamorphic rock. However, to the west, around Sgurr nan Gillean and Glas Bheinn, the Papcastle Gneiss has been intruded by the Kintail Granite, giving rise to a more mottled appearance in this part of the Cuillin. A further complex of rocks is exposed on the north side of Glen Brittle, which includes the Torridonian Sandstone, Lewisian Gneiss, and Dalradian schists.\n\nFigure 2. Geology of Skye showing the main rock types.\n\n\nPeaks\n\nAs well as providing interest to geologists, the geomorphology of the Cuillin is also fascinating for climbers and walkers. With so many ridges and peaks, there is much to explore, and each summit offers its own rewards. Some of the individual peaks are not very high, but offer serious scrambles and rock climbs, while others, such as the highest summit of Sgurr nan Gillean (1,018 m) and the first major peak on the Central Cuillin Ridge, Sgurr Dearg (974 m), offer impressive views.

We have been searching for this lady for several days, and when the Herald office was last searched, we overlooked this message.\n\nAnother story of the stolen money says the woman, whose name is not given, gave the money to a young man who said he was a messenger from St. Catherine, and promised to deliver the money to the party it was addressed to at Kincardine.\n\nTHE MAYOR DISQUALIFIED\n\nA meeting of the citizens of Orangeville was held last Saturday evening at the Orangeville Town Hall, with Dr. A.

It was resolved that the matter be placed before the proper authorities for them to decide. The mayor then withdrew from the hall.\n\nMayor McKenzie\u2019s statement in relation to his withdrawal from office is as follows:\n\n\u201cIn this connection I have no desire to act in any unbecoming manner, and I shall resign from the position of mayor. However, I do not desire to leave town. I will reside here and attend to my business as usual, and my many friends who know me and who are not residents of the municipality will be glad to meet me. I want to get at the bottom of this business and find out who it was that drew up the notice of my being disqualified. I was the first one to speak in this town against the big sewer, but I am satisfied now that my opinions are shared by the majority. I do not think that the matter will go much further than the city hall, and as soon as the legal steps are taken the city will be rid of this question.\u201d\n\nSILVER ORGANIZATION\n\nWe are glad to learn that a Silver organization has been formed in this town, and that a meeting is to be held at the Orangeville Opera House next Saturday evening. This is an organization for the purpose of working for free silver, and they are working under the leadership of W. H.

The sky has always been full of questions. Our ability to dream big and speculate has enabled us to discover, theorize, and theorize even more. But where do we get the answers? These are the top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n10. Extraterrestrial Origin\n\nThe human race began to emerge from the Stone Age. The caves and forests were just getting familiar with the new inhabitants. There was a long time of fear and ignorance. Before we started to understand the world, they began to imagine what is outside the world. Some thought of creatures so powerful that they could destroy the world. Other speculated that we are a higher level of evolution and are the result of genetic experimentation of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nLater, these speculations were transformed into mythology and the imagination of the humans. In our modern world, it has turned into science. Many scientists still believe that we are not the only life in the universe and that at some point in history there was a connection with extraterrestrials. Some of them even believe that the first stages of our life were carried out with the help of aliens.\n\n9. Time Travel\n\nSince the beginning of history, people have always been fascinated with time. To travel back in time would allow us to explore the unknown, but would it be worth it? We live in a world where time is constant. Change is one of the most important principles of human life.\n\nNevertheless, many scientists still consider the possibility of time travel. The hypothetical method would be to build a giant machine that would make a hole in time. But how can this happen? It would involve breaking the speed of light and space.\n\nThe machine would have to be so big that it would create a massive black hole. Then the time machine would be moved into the center of the black hole, which would allow it to break the laws of time. So far, scientists have not been able to prove the validity of this theory.\n\n8. Time Travelers\n\nDespite the fact that time travel is still a hypothesis, there are people who believe that it is not. They claim to have traveled back in time to the present or to a previous generation. For this reason, there are also numerous stories about people who claim to have returned from the future to save the world.\n\nMost people who claim to have traveled back in time are just crazy. However, many scientists consider it possible that in the future, when we understand the laws of physics better, we may be able to travel through time. This possibility has been a mystery for a long time. So, this is a list of top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n7. Deja Vu\n\nThe theory of Deja Vu is so controversial that many scientists do not even dare to think about it. The definition of deja vu is, when a person experiences something, although he has never done it before. Many people think of it as a kind of visual hallucination. The most popular theory about the phenomenon is that it is a past memory that has not been triggered by the usual way.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the brain creates a fake memory to deceive the person who feels it. The theory is that in reality the person does not experience a deja vu, but it is an internal response to the same scenario. In short, the brain recognizes the environment and recognizes the story that it represents.\n\nIn this case, the illusion is that the person has lived through this scenario. Nevertheless, there are many people who do not think so. The reason is that deja vu is a phenomenon that occurs in any person. So, we have 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n6. Water World\n\nIt is one of the most popular theories in the world of science. It is believed that the moon is a result of a collision between the Earth and a body much larger than it. As a result of the collision, our planet was literally ripped. But what happened to the mass that fell on the surface? According to scientists, this part of the Earth remained liquid.\n\nThe evidence is so compelling that the theory of the water world has become a reality. For example, there is a large number of scientists who believe that the moon was the result of the Earth\u2019s rotation and gravitational collapse.\n\nMoreover, there are evidences that this theory may be true. For example, when scientists tried to drill in the Antarctic, they found water underneath. Also, according to many scientists, the planet Mercury, which has no magnetic field, may be the result of the remains of the water world.\n\n5]" time="0.339"><properties><property name="score" value="0.06907027" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[There are no spoilers in this review\n\nFrom the off, the third episode in the new Star Trek Discovery series has a slow pace. It is the most quiet of the three episodes and is more of a character study in the struggles faced by all of the Discovery crew and how that manifests in different ways. With that in mind, I find it strange that this is not getting the universal praise that the first two episodes were. But that\u2019s the power of spoilers I suppose, no one knew what was coming in the first two episodes.\n\nThe episode itself, despite being more quiet than the first two, still manages to deliver plenty of story. You do have to take it with a grain of salt because some of the \u2018bad guy\u2019 stuff is almost unbelievably naive but that\u2019s the Star Trek universe for you. Despite the low stakes, I was still hooked on every word and scene.\n\nThere are plenty of hints that we can be certain that there is a big bad out there that we have not seen yet. Perhaps that is what made the episode more interesting. There is something looming over them and we don\u2019t know what it is yet.\n\nFor some reason, people seem to have a problem with the fact that the crew spend time getting to know one another, with only a couple of scenes of violence and action. Personally, I found that the social dynamics between the characters to be very interesting and engaging. Yes, this is probably true to life and does have some real life parallels. I am glad they did not waste time with all of that mindless action that I\u2019ve become so accustomed to.\n\nThere are no huge shocks in this episode and the pay offs to the mini story arcs were a bit weak. But when the pay off came, I was still glad that they took the time to introduce us to the characters in this way.\n\nIf you have been put off watching Star Trek Discovery because of the fear of spoilers, then I would suggest you don\u2019t worry too much and go ahead and start the show. If you can manage to resist the temptation of the spoilers for the next two weeks, then I think you will be very happy with the third episode and the direction the show is heading in.\n\nLet us know what you thought of the episode in the comments below and if you have seen the first two episodes.]" time="0.336"><properties><property name="score" value="0.32030076" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[You might know of me.

He is from the state of Texas. He has lived in New York City for a few years, but has now moved back to Texas. He is 40 years old and has been writing books for a long time. His first book was published in 2001.\n\nErnest Cline is very much into old science fiction books, and especially the 1980\u2019s. He loves the music, TV shows, video games and movies of that decade.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nWhen I read this book, I really couldn\u2019t put it down. I just wanted to know how the story would end. I wanted to know if the good guys would win. I wanted to know how they would beat the bad guys.\n\nI am sure you will love this book, just like I did.

Harry returns to Hogwarts to retrieve the prophecy from Voldemort.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione get ambushed by Death Eaters, and when Harry goes after the prophecies, he ends up dueling with Voldemort.\n\nHarry calls upon the remaining strength of his mother\u2019s love, and as Voldemort\u2019s Killing Curse rebounds upon him and hits Harry, the battle is ended, and the school is cleared of the Death Eaters.\n\nHarry wakes up to find Dumbledore, Sirius, and Remus in the hospital wing, as well as his friends and the rest of the school, and he realizes that he is safe.\n\nDumbledore then proceeds to give Harry his restored invisibility cloak, explaining to Harry that the Invisibility Cloak is one of the Deathly Hallows. Harry then says goodbye to his friends, as he leaves with Dumbledore to destroy the seven horcruxes that contain fragments of Voldemort\u2019s soul, which will make him immortal.\n\nThe film ends with Harry and Dumbledore leaving the school in a car, accompanied by Professor Minerva McGonagall.\n\nI liked this movie as it is full of action and adventure. The plot is great as well as the dialogue. It is a well made movie and it is very entertaining.\n\nThis movie is definitely a must-watch, as it has plenty of action as well as being very humorous.\n\nAdvertisements]" time="0.559"><properties><property name="score" value="0.00871626285" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00871626&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00871626

And people did not like that. I remember having this conversation where somebody said to me, \u2018When you are perceived as yourself, people have a hard time relating to that.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I think you are misperceiving yourself to be someone who has a choice.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying this like, \u2018Hey, world, my message is this, and you\u2019re going to like it.\u2019 That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about the moment in which you are caught off guard, and you\u2019re on tour and you\u2019re not doing what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, but you\u2019re still getting a check.&quot;\n\nOn The Benefits Of Ghostwriting:\n\n&quot;I don\u2019t have any beef with the world. I\u2019ve got a bunch of kids and a beautiful girlfriend and a house that I love and that\u2019s not an accident. And I\u2019ve worked for that and I\u2019ve gotten that because I\u2019m an easygoing guy who really enjoys life. And I\u2019ve always been super-vigilant about my ability to access joy.&quot;\n\nOn Being A 'Bubblegum Pop Star':\n\n&quot;I was, for a very brief period of time, a bubblegum pop star. I was in the No. 1 pop band of the late-\u201990s, early 2000s. I\u2019ve had 18 or 19 top 10 songs. I have the right to call myself a singer, I guess. But I would never want to turn my back on being a guitar player and a songwriter. And the reason why is because I have a fan base that loves me for being a guitar player and a songwriter, and it\u2019s very separate from the people who like my pop songs.&quot;\n\nHis Concert Review Regrets:\n\n&quot;I was like, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to be under these bright lights, and it\u2019s going to be this one moment in time where we\u2019re going to play it for you. And we want to give you the most you can get for your dollar.\u2019 And then I think I had a bad couple of years. And I lost myself and tried to get myself back, and now I\u2019m playing shows where, like, I\u2019m not having a good time.&quot;\n\nOn Live Music Criticism:\n\n&quot;I think we\u2019re overintellectualizing music. The discussion about music is so myopic and minuscule. \u2018He did this, and it\u2019s a disservice to this particular song.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, well, maybe you don\u2019t like this song. If you don\u2019t like it, just don\u2019t buy it. But that\u2019s not the way it works anymore. So I think we\u2019ve been eating the meat and spitting out the bones. You just want to get the marrow.&quot;\n\nThe New York Times concludes by highlighting the vocal coaching he undertook in 2015 in order to overcome his vocal issues:\n\n&quot;I went and saw a vocal coach who I had seen when I was on my 'John Mayer's Journey Continues' world tour. She was a big hero of mine. She\u2019s the one who said to me, 'John, you just don\u2019t like how you sound. Why don\u2019t you do something about it?' I said, 'I can\u2019t afford to do anything about it.\u2019 She said, 'That\u2019s not true.\u2019 &quot;\n\nWatch our video of John's recent live cover of 'A Hard Day's Night' here:]" time="0.301"><properties><property name="score" value="0.019235214" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01923521&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01923521
