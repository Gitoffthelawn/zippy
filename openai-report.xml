Most notable are the sports teams, especially their basketball teams, which have qualified for state competition multiple times. The school has also had various music groups participate in state and regional competitions, and in the 2010-2011 school year, the school sent students to participate in an International Children's Games competition in Romania.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 school year, a group of the school's teachers were sent to Haiti to help establish a new orphanage, &quot;Eli's Children's House&quot;, which was dedicated to Eli Pierre, who had died in a motorcycle accident. They were instrumental in bringing the orphanage into the community by helping establish new programs for the children, including English as a Second Language, Computer Lab, and Physical Education classes. The teachers assisted in the education of the orphans as well as working with the staff on the property.\n\nThe school has also taken various trips over the years, including trips to Virginia and New York City. The school also hosted an educational trip to Washington D.C. for one of their graduating classes.\n\nThe school has participated in various community events and service projects. One of the most notable is their annual &quot;Twilight Prom&quot; that is held each spring. Each year, the school hosts a prom for local high school students who have special needs. The students' dates are typically their own siblings.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, a fire destroyed the school's auditorium, causing over $1 million in damages.

He does not want people to perish but be saved. God hates sin, and sin destroys a person. But He loves people. He created them to have fellowship with Him and one day live in His Kingdom, and He does not want that for one person to be lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod's command to Ezekiel was that He was telling him to go and tell the people of Israel that they need to turn to God, because they were going to die if they did not. We know that Ezekiel told them the same thing, because God's word is truth. God's Word does not fail.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat God is saying is that people are going to die if they do not turn to Him. People who reject God will die. The Bible says in Romans 1:32, &quot;Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.&quot; God says that those people who do these things deserve death, and yet people continue to do them and approve of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod will not tolerate the sinful acts of humanity, but He wants every person to be saved. There is only one way to be saved. The Bible says in John 14:6, &quot;Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one can be saved except through Jesus Christ, but when people put Jesus as their savior, they are saved. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many people who call themselves Christians who say that God wants everyone to be saved, and they quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, but they don't realize that God's word is truth. God says in Revelation 21:8, &quot;But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars\u2014their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one way to be saved, and it is not through anyone or anything but Jesus Christ. Jesus is the only way to heaven. God says that all the people who are going to perish are going to go to a place called the second death. That's hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, they don't realize that God's word is truth. They don't realize that when they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are not telling the truth. When they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are putting God in a box, because God's word is truth. God says that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior are going to perish. God's word is truth, and people who do not put their faith in Jesus Christ are going to die.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bible says in John 14:6, &quot;Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus is the only way to the Father, and no one can be saved except through Him. He died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead on the third day, and He sits at the right hand of God, interceding for us. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at Ezekiel 33:11-11, and read it carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says that He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. God does not like it when people die. But God hates sin, and sin leads to death. If people want to live, they must turn from their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf people don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. God doesn't want that. He doesn't want people to perish, but to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod wants people to put their faith in Jesus Christ. If people put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are saved. If they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. That's the truth. That's the message of Ezekiel 33:11-11.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople are going to die if they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ. People will perish. People will be lost. People will be doomed. People will go to hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's read Ezekiel 33:11-12.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone,&quot; declares the Sovereign Lord. &quot;Repent and live!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nGod takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. God does not want anyone to perish. He doesn't want anyone to die. He wants people to repent and live. God is saying that He is not going to stand back and watch as people perish.

Let's say I have the following array of numbers:\n\nvar myNumbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\nThe following snippet of code would display the same numbers in reverse order:\n\nfor ( var i = myNumbers.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i-- ) { console.log( myNumbers[i] ); }\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nWe know that the index of an array can be used as a &quot;pointer&quot; to the location in memory that contains a particular item in an array. If the array myNumbers has five items, then myNumbers[0] , myNumbers[1] , myNumbers[2] , myNumbers[3] and myNumbers[4] will point to the values 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nIn the previous example, the code starts with the length of the array (5) and subtracts one from it. As we know that index 0 in an array contains the first item in the array, the previous code will execute the following steps:\n\nTake the length of the array (5) Subtract 1 (so we now have 4) Start at the index that contains the first item in the array (myNumbers[4] = 3) and run down the array until we reach the last item in the array (myNumbers[3] = 5)\n\nSo the above code will end up displaying the items in the array in reverse order, starting at index 4 and working backwards to index 0.\n\nAt this point, we have a good idea of how we can access the values in an array in a specific order, but how do we go the other way?\n\nIt would be great if we could simply use the same code as above, but add a &quot;--&quot; operator before the last number. That way, we could add a simple parameter to the code to control the range of numbers it will use.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't do that. While JavaScript will happily work with -- , it will also happily take -- in code and convert it to -1 , or the last number in an array. That's not going to do us any good, as we want the code to be flexible enough that we can work with a number that we specify as the range of numbers.\n\nSo let's look at a simple function that can give us the results we need.\n\nfunction rotate(numbers, direction, number) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push(number); numbers.unshift(number); };\n\nThe rotate function above has three parameters, and will rotate the values in the numbers array.\n\nnumbers is the array we want to use.\n\ndirection is the parameter that allows us to choose whether we want the values to be rotated in the direction we specify. In this case, we've chosen direction to be either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;\n\nnumber is the number we're using as the upper bound of the range that we want to use.\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\n\nAs we can see, the numbers array is simply rotated right by the number we specified. That's fine, but let's add in some code that we can use to control which numbers are displayed:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 1 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 4, 3, 5, 2 ]\n\nWe can see that we've rotated the numbers so that the first number in the array is now number 1 , and the next number in the array is 4 .\n\nWe've also specified that we want to rotate in a right-handed manner, by passing &quot;right&quot; as the second parameter. This means that we have access to the following rotation values:\n\nrotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; );\n\nIf we try to access the rotate function with &quot;left&quot; as the parameter, we'll see the following output:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nNot quite what we wanted, right?\n\nWhat we want is to be able to take an array, specify the number of numbers we want to display, and be able to choose the direction of rotation.\n\nWe also want to ensure that the values we are displaying are always within the array's bounds, and we're using them correctly.\n\nThe good news is that it's not too difficult to do this. We simply need to know what we want the code to look like, and write the code to do what we want it to do.\n\nLet's take a look at some simple code to display the numbers in an array in a given direction:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nrotateArray function\n\nThis is the code we'll use to display the numbers in the numbers array in the direction we specify. We'll start with a simple parameter:\n\nstartAt is the number we're displaying. It can either be the first number in the array, or any number within the array.\n\nLet's take a look at the code again:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing this simple function, we can take any number of numbers, and display them in the direction we want. Let's look at a quick example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;left&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nThis time, we've used &quot;left&quot; as the direction, and we've also used the parameter &quot;3&quot; as the startAt value. The result is that we now have the numbers displayed in the array starting at the number 3 .\n\nIf we use a number that isn't within the bounds of the array, we'll get the following result:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nAs you can see, the direction we've specified is &quot;right&quot;, and the value we've specified for startAt is 3 . Unfortunately, this value isn't within the bounds of the array, so the values in the array have been displayed starting from the last number in the array.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can use this code to work with a number that's outside the bounds of the array:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 6 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nThis time, we've specified &quot;right&quot; as the direction, and a value of 6 as the startAt parameter. The result is that we now have the values displayed in the array starting at the number 6 .\n\nThis time, the result we want is displayed in the array, but there's a problem. We don't want the number 6 to be the start of the array. Instead, we want it to be the last number in the array.\n\nThe good news is that we can easily handle this by modifying the code slightly:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing the simple rotation code above, we can now take any array, specify the number we want to display, and choose the direction we want to use. This means we can write some simple code that can work with any number, regardless of its position in the array.\n\nThe next step is to write some code that can ensure the number we specify as the startAt is in the range that we expect.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can do that:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { if( startAt &gt;= numbers.length ) { throw new RangeError(&quot;Start at is outside of the]" time="0.581"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0009482333" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Contents\n\n1. The Meaning of Love\n\n2. Our Attitude Toward Others\n\n3. The Two Great Commandments\n\n4. Developing Love\n\n5. How to Help Others\n\n6. The Golden Rule\n\n7. The Commandments in the New Testament\n\n8. Tolerance\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Meaning of Love\n\nBefore we can love others, we must know the meaning of love. It is important to love God and obey Him and to have a right relationship with Him. But to have a right relationship with Him we must love Him. That means that we must have a good relationship with all His laws.\n\nOf course we can't keep all the commandments all the time. Yet we must have a good relationship with them. Otherwise we will not know what God is like.\n\nLove is based on God's law.\n\nRomans 13:10. The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nGalatians 5:14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nLove is based on God's law. We should study God's commandments and know the laws He has given us. Then we will know how to have a good relationship with Him.\n\nOne reason we are to love God and obey Him is that it is important to have a good relationship with God. We need to know how much God loves us. Without knowing this we cannot have a right relationship with God. We need to have a good relationship with Him so we can be happy and serve Him better.\n\nLet us understand what love is.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nIn these verses John explained that love is the opposite of lawlessness. Love is the opposite of murder, hatred, malice, evil, adultery, stealing, lying, and a lot of other bad things.\n\nRomans 13:8-10. Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law. For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\n\nWe learn from this that the opposite of love is lawlessness. The opposite of love is murder, hatred, envy, malice, evil, and all the other things mentioned in these verses.\n\nVerse 10 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; In other words, love is a good thing. It is a good thing to have a good relationship with God.\n\nRomans 13:8 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; Love helps and blesses others.\n\nLove is a good thing. The reason love is a good thing is because God is love.\n\n1 John 4:16. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love; and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.\n\nVerse 8 says, &quot;God is love.&quot; God's name is Love.\n\nGod's name is Love.\n\nJohn 4:8. \u2026 the well was deep; and I said, &quot;How shall I get down?&quot;\n\nAnd he said, &quot;Come, and I will show you.&quot;\n\n9. And he said, &quot;Draw you [a] little water out of the well, and \u2026 drink.&quot;\n\n10. And I said, &quot;Sir, give me [a] little to drink.&quot;\n\n11. And he said, &quot;Drink, my [b] son, and \u2026 your eyes shall be opened.&quot;\n\n12. And I drank, and it was as if I had had new vision given to me; for I could see [c] through those walls of water.\n\n13. And he said to me, &quot;Go [a] down, for the water is [b] yet a little way below the earth. \u2026\n\n15. \u2026 This water is [c] that which I said \u2026 will make you come up hither.&quot;\n\n16. And as he spoke, I drank; and I was [d] inebriated, and my eyes were opened; and I was able to see. \u2026\n\n19. \u2026 &quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;follow me \u2026 and I will give you \u2026 rest.&quot;\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:9. \u2026 God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nGod is our salvation. God is our rest. God is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\n1 Peter 2:6. \u2026 you may be \u2026 a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.\n\nGod is our first fruits.\n\n2 Timothy 2:13. If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he cannot deny himself.\n\nGod is faithful.\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nHebrews 4:10-13. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his own works, as God did from His. Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest \u2026\n\n12. \u2026 For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\n13. \u2026 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 3:16,18. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\n\n19. But whoso has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nThe Bible says that God is love.\n\nWe can study love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

But the opposite of love is not lawlessness. The opposite of love is law.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving Him.\n\nThe Bible says that God is love.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving Him.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving God.\n\nJohn 14:21.

Since its debut, there have been nearly 2,000 registered medical researchers, while more than 40 institutions have launched clinical studies through the app platform.\n\n\n\nBut there are several hurdles for Apple and its partners. On Wednesday, Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, will join at a panel discussion at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to examine what works and what\u2019s missing in the fast-evolving field of mobile health.\n\n\n\nThe session, titled \u201cWhat Are the Future Directions for ResearchKit?\u201d comes after a first wave of successful projects on ResearchKit, including apps that help people manage diabetes, heart disease and asthma.\n\n\n\nThere are also some examples of the problems Apple is facing as it tries to get more partners to adopt the tool. Earlier this month, a major player in the diabetes community said it would not be taking part in the app\u2019s data collection. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said in a statement that its members were not interested in the iPhone platform and \u201cwould prefer to conduct research studies using our own patient data that is gathered on an Android platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s likely an expensive prospect for the organization, given the popularity of iPhones in the United States. As of last year, Android devices accounted for just over half of all U.S. smartphone subscribers, while iOS devices made up around 41 percent. That\u2019s according to the Pew Research Center, which estimated last year that there were 121 million iPhone users in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe success of Apple\u2019s platform will hinge in part on how it handles data privacy and security concerns. Apple had to clear some hurdles in the early days of ResearchKit because many people were concerned about privacy when they heard it would rely on data from Apple\u2019s servers. Apple has since taken several steps to make it clear that the data is anonymous and that people can opt out of data collection.\n\n\n\nThe app program could also be a major part of the iPhone\u2019s future if it takes off. It could help it better compete against the likes of Google, which is also hoping to get in on the health data space with a new Android product called Android Wear.\n\n\n\nThe first public version of ResearchKit will be unveiled on Wednesday, the panel will also include representatives from Mount Sinai and Pfizer.\n\n\n\nThat event will be at 11:30 a.m. EDT in New York City, and it will be livestreamed on Fortune\u2019s website.]" time="0.323"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0012089905" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00120899&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00120899

You may have a thousand bucks of cordless tools, but there\u2019s nothing that will do as much as this one will do. As you might have noticed, the construction of this unit is incredibly sturdy, so that you don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking when you use it. Also, it is a bit heavy, and it will take a while to get used to using it, especially if you have not used any other heavy drills.\n\nPower\n\nWe also tested the power of this Dewalt DW3200 and we must say that it is very impressive. It delivers 3,300 RPM, which is more than enough to bore holes and drill in all kinds of materials. It can easily penetrate into wood, brick, or concrete and it can bore holes up to two inches. The trigger lock mechanism also works well, which makes this drill safer to use.\n\nCordless or corded?\n\nIt is important to remember that this drill can work either as a corded or a cordless unit, and this is very important for you to know. This Dewalt DW3200 uses the 20 volt lithium-ion batteries and they can last longer than you might expect. They are also very light and durable, so you will be able to use them for a long time. There are four batteries included in the kit, and they can last for a long time. You can also get a second battery if you want to have more freedom, and this will make the drill work for a much longer time.\n\nExtra Features\n\nYou may also like the extra features included in this Dewalt DW3200. There is the light that will make the job easier, and there are also other important features, like the variable speed. This is also a very durable drill, so it will last for a very long time. Also, the build quality is fantastic, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking easily.\n\nOverall\n\nIf you have a lot of different drilling needs, this is the drill for you. This drill is perfect for the casual user, but it can also be used by professionals. It is also very durable, so you can use it for a very long time, and you will get the most for your money. You should also remember that this drill is very powerful, and it can work for a long time, without breaking down.\n\nIf you want to see what more we have, you can visit Amazon.com and check all of the available drills.

Sometimes, the changes within the industry are so drastic that a superstar's popularity can get left in the past. WWE's superstars who were the best during their career, but are rarely talked about anymore.\n\nWWE is still the leader of the wrestling world. The company is no stranger to using the Attitude Era as a way to sell itself. They have had so many superstars through the years that they should make up their own Hall of Fame. Some of those superstars are the ones who are mentioned the most.\n\nThe casual fan knows about Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold, and The Rock. That is what makes this so fun.

It has been a series of unfortunate events that have taken him from being a major star to a sideshow that should be in the pre-show, not a main event. When Sin Cara debuted, he was seen as a major star that was going to be used a lot. It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe problem was that he never delivered.\n\nHe was so unimpressive that he was booted from WWE in 2016. He is making an appearance at WrestleMania 33. For his sake, it would be best if he kept quiet and didn't interact with the crowd.\n\n9 Kelly Kelly\n\nvia tumblr.com\n\nKelly Kelly was a fan favorite during her time in WWE. She made her debut as a popular model who was wrestling on ECW. From there, she rose to the top as a valuable part of the roster. Kelly became a popular figure who had her own dedicated fans. She had the right amount of talent to be a decent worker, but it was her good looks that gave her the extra push.\n\nAfter leaving WWE in 2012, Kelly kept wrestling. She is back on the roster with TNA, but she has not appeared on a television episode of Impact Wrestling since December of 2015.\n\n8 Alberto Del Rio\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is a sad truth that Alberto Del Rio has fallen from his former position in the industry. He was a very big part of WWE. He was not only the United States Champion, but also a World Champion. Alberto had a unique presence as a superstar that could do things no one else could do. He also had the microphone skills to back up his moves.\n\nHis tenure in WWE was marred with incidents that made it clear he was not going to be there much longer. His time in Lucha Underground was more memorable, but it was a step down from what he used to be.\n\n7 The Great Khali\n\nvia cagesideseats.com\n\nThe Great Khali is not really a superstar that anyone really misses. His presence was laughable at times. The thing about Khali is that he had a lot of potential. He was very big and very strong, but he never seemed to have any clue about how to use those traits to his advantage.\n\nKhali is now an actor and a former wrestler. He is part of the reality show Khali Kisses, which involves him doing a lot of kisses on people. It is a far cry from his WWE days.\n\n6 Kelly Kelly's Boyfriend\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nWrestlers who are lucky enough to find a wife have a much easier time in the wrestling industry. The same could not be said for Mike Knox. He was only a superstar for a very short time, and he was a part of one of the most bizarre moments in wrestling history when he got the Attitude Adjustment from Kane. Knox is not talked about much these days, but there was a time when people were curious about him.\n\nHe married the popular WWE superstar Kelly Kelly. The couple got married in 2014. It was a marriage that was not meant to last, as the couple divorced in 2016.\n\n5 Santino Marella\n\nvia ringsidenews.com\n\nSantino Marella will forever be a part of WWE. The WWE Hall of Fame is home to some great wrestlers and some very bad wrestlers. Santino is among those who have made an impression for one reason or another. His career with the company was not as successful as he had hoped, but he made a huge impact. He was the guy who was hilarious because he was so bad.\n\nSantino's last match was in 2014. He has done some backstage work, but the star has pretty much disappeared from WWE.\n\n4 Tyson Kidd\n\nvia heavy.com\n\nTyson Kidd was a true performer in WWE. He had a unique look, and he could really do it all. The man was skilled on the mic, in the ring, and he had a good personality. Everything came together for Tyson, but that would all change during an unfortunate injury. Tyson was a mid-carder who could have risen to a top level, but that was not meant to be.\n\nKidd is now recovering from his neck injury. He is still hoping to get into the ring again, but it is looking unlikely.\n\n3 Christian\n\nvia bodybuilding.com\n\nChristian is not a name that is being mentioned much these days. It is a shame, as he is one of the best performers of his time. Christian has made a career of being known for his impressive in-ring work and his ability to entertain fans. Christian was a popular superstar during his time in WWE and he did some good things for TNA.\n\nChristian has not been in the ring since December of 2015. He is trying to get back into the ring, but there is a possibility that his neck injury may have ended his career.\n\n2 Dolph Ziggler\n\nvia wrestlingnewssource.com\n\nDolph Ziggler had the chance to become a very big star in WWE. Unfortunately, things have not been going well for Ziggler. He was once a main eventer, but he has fallen to the bottom of the card. He is one of the many guys who will be pushed as the underdog who is going to have the moment of their life.\n\nZiggler has not been the focus of WWE. It is likely that he will be entering a new chapter of his career in the near future. The most likely place would be in Ring of Honor, but WWE has shown a lot of interest in Ziggler.\n\n1 Wade Barrett\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the casual fan to remember Wade Barrett. He had a short run in WWE, but he did his part as a mid-carder. Barrett is a former Intercontinental Champion. He did well in WWE as a member of The Nexus, but his star power never quite took off.\n\nBarrett has been out of WWE since 2014. He has had some ups and downs in the independent circuit, but his career has largely gone downhill. It is possible that he could get another chance with WWE. That would probably be the only way that fans would get to see him again.\n\nBarrett has been trying to make a name for himself in the business world. He launched a website last year. It is not likely that he will become a success, but it is nice to see him try to make something of his life.]" time="1.531"><properties><property name="score" value="0.145252773" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.14525277&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.14525277

So, how have you all been doing?\n\nToday, I have a special post. I know most of you do not know but it is the 'World Animal Day'. The day is celebrated worldwide on October 4 to create awareness of animal rights and welfare. The day is a very special one for me because I am a vegetarian, animal lover and a dog-person.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the last one year, I have been trying to spread the awareness among the people. I have been trying to encourage people to stop using animals as fur coats, cosmetics and for food. I want people to know the feelings of these animals, the pains they suffer and what they go through while they are alive. Also, the environmental damage they cause to the planet. It is very important to spread this message because animals are treated as if they are some sort of toys that we can play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, I would like to share with you some tips on how we can help the animals and make the planet a better place to live. I also have a small personal pledge to make. Also, if you have not signed the pledge yet, you can also make your own pledge to protect the animals and the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips and pledges to help the animals\n\n(made by my friend!)\n\nOne way we can make a change is by making an effort to not use cosmetics that are tested on animals. We can choose to use all cruelty free products and make a conscious effort not to use anything that has been tested on animals.\n\nWays to reduce our carbon footprints and help protect the environment:\n\nAvoid eating meat, or even better, go vegetarian (dairy, eggs are not vegan but I still encourage you to stop using dairy products as well)\n\nUse eco-friendly products - Not just cosmetics but also in our everyday lives.\n\nGo cruelty free - Choose cruelty free products and wear clothes that have not been made out of leather, fur or wool.\n\nStop buying those animals that we do not need. Also, choose to buy second hand or recycled clothes. Avoid buying pets if you cannot provide the proper care for them.\n\nAdopt, don't buy! You can adopt a dog or cat from an animal shelter.

Roots can become entangled in the small cracks between the asphalt and the cement to create the impression that the tree is growing out of the road! And when the roots do become entwined, the pressure can be so great that the roots are destroyed. We all know the danger this creates for the trees.\n\nThe solution to this problem is obvious: pave over the whole road surface. Not so fast! In the City of Chicago, for example, there is a practice that preserves the utility of the tree\u2019s roots and of the road surface itself. The practice is called \u201cmilling\u201d. Milling involves cutting the asphalt out in a shape that will not disturb the roots and adding back in a new surface. While the tree is protected, the roots are not disturbed and the road surface is left intact. When a tree is scheduled for removal, this is often the method of choice. Milling also involves improving the root zone around the tree. The roots of many trees can\u2019t penetrate the compacted soil that is found beneath pavement, so it is necessary to mill the area to promote root growth.\n\nMilling is less expensive than paving over a road surface and can also be less expensive than removal of a tree.

For some, the reason is because they still have some of their shopping list to complete. Others, however, have an entirely different reason.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian adult will spend $473.12 on gifts this holiday season. That means the average consumer will spend almost $35 more this year than last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of consumers have gone overboard,\u201d says Ted Michalos, founder of CMG Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the spending that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s what they\u2019re spending the money on.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because many shoppers are buying gifts for themselves. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re spending on the latest fashions, but rather toys and electronics. And the majority of these gifts, at 41.8 per cent, are going to be purchased online.\n\nHowever, the reason why so many people are spending online is because they\u2019re trying to avoid the crowds and waiting in lines.\n\n\u201cSome consumers just get too stressed and they go online to get their stuff,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd if they do that, they\u2019re likely going to be paying more for the gifts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because while there are fewer people at the store, they\u2019re paying more per person. For example, if someone is paying $50 for a gift in the store, they\u2019re likely to pay more than $50 online.\n\n\u201cThis is really the time where you\u2019re going to have to do your best to have everything done by the 15th,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd it\u2019s definitely a good idea to sit down with your spouse or significant other and look at your budget.

At the time of this writing, there are two options: SharePointContext and SPUtility. Both work fine, and I think it\u2019s really up to your personal preference and comfort level to choose either. But for my purposes, I\u2019m a fan of using SharePointContext because it will use the most current context available, which is what I like to do.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the two SharePoint context providers that we have at our disposal: SharePointContext and SPUtility. We\u2019ll use these in conjunction with the new SharePoint REST API to get a SharePoint context.\n\nSharePointContext\n\nThe SharePointContext class represents a SharePoint context. The context is the central part of the SharePoint client object model, and it\u2019s available from any client, including SharePoint-hosted, remote, or SharePoint-hosted-remote applications.\n\nTo create a SharePointContext object, you call the SharePointContext.GetContextAsync() method and pass in a SharePointContextOptions object. The SharePointContextOptions object provides the user information and authentication settings. We\u2019ll dive into the details in the \u201cAuthorization\u201d section of this article.\n\nOnce you have your context, you can then call methods on it. The context has a number of methods on it to retrieve different information.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the available methods:\n\nGetContextAsync() - The method that is used to create the context.\n\n\n\n- The method that is used to create the context. SharePointContextPermission - The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user. SharePointPermissions - The property that contains the current permission level of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current permission level of the user. ListPermissions - The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists. SPHostUrl - The property that contains the URL of the current host application.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the URL of the current host application. Site - The property that contains the current site of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current site of the user. UserPrincipalName - The property that contains the username of the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the username of the current user. Web - The property that contains the current web of the user.\n\n\n\nSPUtility\n\nThe SPUtility class provides static methods to retrieve a SharePoint context and return it. To get the context, you call the SPUtility.GetSharePointContext() method.\n\nThe methods you have available on the SPUtility.SharePointContext object are:\n\nClientContext\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\nGetClientContext()\n\n\n\nGetWeb()\n\n\n\nSharePointContext Permission\n\nBefore we dive into the SharePoint context, let\u2019s talk about permission. The SharePoint context is going to be pretty useless without a permission token. We\u2019re going to talk about this permission token a lot in this article, so let\u2019s just take a quick look at how it\u2019s generated.\n\nWe\u2019ll need to use the SharePoint permissions provider to generate the token. To do so, you\u2019ll need to call the SharePointPermissionManager.GetPermissionsAsync() method. You\u2019ll need to pass in an instance of the site where you want the permissions for.\n\nIn this example, we\u2019re going to call GetPermissionsAsync() and get the current user\u2019s permissions.\n\nGetPermissionsAsync() returns a SharePointPermissions object, which you can use to set your permissions on lists, folders, and documents. The SharePoint permissions are applied in a single pass. This means that you can\u2019t apply different permissions to different entities. For example, if you want to apply permissions on the web, the site, and the lists and folders, you\u2019ll need to pass in the permission on the web, then on the site, then on the lists and folders. You can, however, pass in different permissions to different lists and folders.\n\nOne other thing to note about SharePoint permissions is that they only grant access to the web, not to the list or to the folder itself.\n\nFor example, if a user doesn\u2019t have the Edit permission to a list, he will still be able to view it. But if the user has the Edit permission to the list, he will be able to edit it.\n\nIf you want to deny access to the whole list, you can set the permissions for the list and all its subfolders to Deny.\n\nIn order to create the context, we\u2019ll use the context, the SharePoint permissions provider, and a helper class, which we\u2019ll talk about later in the article. The full example is shown in Listing 1.\n\nThe context object will now be passed to the constructor of a class called FileRootsProvider. The FileRootsProvider class is part of a helper class that I wrote and will be available to you in this article.\n\nThe provider will be created with the context and then called to generate the access token. Once the access token is generated, it will be returned to us, and we can start to retrieve information about the site and its lists and folders.\n\nAccess Token\n\nWhen you call the SharePoint permissions provider, you\u2019ll receive a token that represents the permissions for the current user. The token is returned as a SharePointPermissions object, which is what we\u2019ll use to apply the permissions.\n\nTo create a SharePointPermissions object, you need to pass in the site URL where the permissions should apply. For our example, we\u2019ll pass in the site URL to the SharePointPermissions constructor.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve created the permissions, you can apply them to the lists and folders. You can do this by passing in an instance of a list or folder to the SharePointPermissions constructor. If you want to apply permissions to all lists and folders, you can simply pass in an empty list or folder.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve created the permissions, we can use the FileRootsProvider class to generate the access token. The access token is returned as a SharePointContextPermissions object. The SharePointContextPermissions object contains the permission token and other details that we\u2019ll use to get information from the SharePoint site.\n\nAs you can see, the code to get the access token is pretty straightforward. The example is shown in Listing 2.\n\nList\n\nGetting the access token isn\u2019t all you need to do. You also need to be able to get a list and get a list item. To do this, you\u2019ll need to call the SharePointContext.GetListAsync() method. The method is easy to use and returns a list object.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a specific list, you can pass in the list GUID or the URL of the list. Listing 3 shows an example of both the URL and GUID to get the lists from.\n\nItems\n\nThe code to get an item from a list is just as easy as getting the list. You can pass in the list item GUID to the GetListItemAsync() method. Listing 4 shows an example of how to get the list item with the GUID.\n\nSummary\n\nThis article was a quick look at how to get a SharePoint context. The examples used a helper class that I created to make it a little easier to get access to lists and items from SharePoint.]" time="0.710"><properties><property name="score" value="0.14727592" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[A few months back, I wrote an article about the journey from yearning to prayer.

In the past, my experience of praying was somewhat a miserable one. It was not that I was not able to pray but the truth was I never really enjoyed the praying process.

There is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. This paper exploits the introduction of minimum attainment targets in the National Curriculum for schools to explore the impact of early education policies on students\u2019 achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nData and methods\n\nAnalysis\n\nDiscussion\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nUniversity participation in the UK has grown substantially since the early 1990s. There are now 1.4 million undergraduates, which is almost double the number in 1992. However, participation rates have remained relatively low among those from lower socioeconomic groups (Furlong and Millar, 2008). For example, 40 per cent of young adults from high-income backgrounds were participating in higher education in 2011-12, compared to 21 per cent from the poorest fifth of families.\n\nTo some extent, low participation among young people from less advantaged backgrounds is to be expected given the historical association of university education with privileged groups. Participation rates increased significantly in the 1960s, after state support for university was extended to less affluent groups. Participation rose further during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, but then stagnated in the 1990s and declined slightly after 2002. Only in the past decade has participation among the less well-off again risen to the levels recorded in the early 1990s (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. University participation rates by parental income, 1962-2012\n\nNote: Figures are cohort entry rates for those who went to university in each year. Sources: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2014); Sutton Trust/Ipsos Mori (2012); Education Policy Institute (2013).\n\nDespite increased participation, the gap in participation rates between young people from more and less advantaged backgrounds is still large, even after controlling for qualifications. On average, young people from the most advantaged fifth of families are about twice as likely to go to university as those from the least advantaged fifth (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Proportion of young people who go to university by family income, 1996-2012\n\nSource: Participation rates (log scale) are from the UCAS End of Cycle Reports, 1996-2012. The relative income quintiles are from the Family Resources Survey, 2008-2012. The quintiles have been adjusted to allow for comparison across years by using a fixed poverty line.\n\nAt a recent seminar organised by the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy, Professor Martin Brown (2012) suggested that it is \u2018a great mystery why this gap is not widening even more\u2019. He also pointed out that there is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. It is well-known that, in addition to their socio-economic background, non-cognitive skills, such as motivation, are important predictors of academic achievement. Since the increase in university participation has been driven by the growth in participation of less advantaged groups, it is not surprising that it has also been associated with a fall in the average grades of university entrants.\n\nThis paper is motivated by this observation, that early education policies have played an important role in the increase in participation among less advantaged groups. We focus on two such policies: the requirement to meet minimum attainment targets in English, mathematics and science, and the national literacy and numeracy strategies. We explore the impact of these policies on students\u2019 achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees. We also find that the increase in the A-level scores and the higher participation rate associated with the introduction of minimum attainment targets cannot be explained by the improvement in the overall level of academic performance in schools or by the lower socioeconomic status of those schools that introduced minimum attainment targets.\n\nData and methods\n\nTo analyse the impact of minimum attainment targets, we use the school-level dataset that the Department for Education makes available annually for the National Pupil Database (NPD). The NPD contains rich information about individual pupils and their schools. We first use the NPD to examine the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education by using cohort-level information on final examinations. We then explore the impact of minimum attainment targets using changes in the composition of achievement. The results we present in this paper are robust to the alternative methods of analysis of achievement levels and changes in the composition of achievement.\n\nIn the first stage of our analysis, we explore the evolution of the A-level examination results by using the cohort-level information on final examinations. To study the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education, we use the data on A-level grades in GCSE and A-level examinations from 1996 to 2012. In this period, the examinations have changed significantly, from the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and the A-level examinations. The A-level examination was first introduced in the early 1950s as an academically rigorous alternative to the less selective B-level examinations (Wynne, 2010). Until 1988, A-level grades (i.e. O/A levels) were assigned by teachers, not by the students. From 1988, the responsibility for grading moved to schools. The examination was revised in the early 1990s, after which it was separated into two components: A-level and AS-level. The A-level examinations were re-structured in 2000. Most importantly, the exams have become linear rather than modular. The exams in each subject are now taken at the end of the two-year course. The exams are now externally assessed, and the grade is assigned according to the nationally defined A-level grade boundaries. The percentage of the cohort that sat the A-level examinations increased from about two-thirds in the early 1990s to more than 90 per cent in the mid-2000s. This reflects a policy shift in the assessment of vocational qualifications, which reduced the proportion of vocational qualifications that counted towards a student\u2019s A-level grade.\n\nWe use a slightly modified version of the grading system developed by Hayward, Parry and Stewart (2009) and Bias et al. (2011). We use a scale of 5 grades to assess the performance of students in different subjects: 5 is an \u2018A*\u2019 grade, 4 is an \u2018A\u2019 grade, 3 is a \u2018B\u2019 grade, 2 is a \u2018C\u2019 grade and 1 is a \u2018D\u2019 grade. The best possible grade in each subject is an \u2018A*\u2019. This grading system differs from the one used in most of the existing analyses of A-level results, which use an A-E grading system. The difference between the two grading systems is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that about 60 per cent of the students in the upper grade boundary of \u2018A*\u2019 under the old system would be below the upper boundary of \u2018A*\u2019 under the new system. Similarly, about 45 per cent of the students in the lower boundary of \u2018C\u2019 would be in the upper boundary of \u2018C\u2019 under the old system, and about 25 per cent of students in the lower boundary of \u2018C\u2019 would be in the upper boundary of \u2018C\u2019 under the new system. We expect that the increase in the A-level scores associated with the change in the grading system will be smaller for subjects that were not directly affected by the reform, such as English, maths and science. We do not analyse students\u2019 performance in the core and non-core subjects, because data on the subject of A-level examination was not available for every pupil.\n\nFigure 3. Grading scales of GCSE and A-level examinations\n\nIn Figure 4, we present the cumulative distribution of A-level scores for each cohort, by the subject studied. Figure 5 shows that the average A-level score increased from a little less than \u2018C\u2019 in 1996 to more than \u2018C\u2019 in 2012, which is consistent with the improvement in the average GCSE results. The gap in the average grades between different subjects remained stable. The increase in the average A-level grades was particularly large in science subjects and in humanities subjects. We do not find evidence of a widening gap in A-level scores between the richest and the poorest students. In the humanities subjects, there is some evidence of an increase in the A-level scores of the less well-off. However, the increase in the average A-level scores was so large that the difference in the average scores between the richest and the poorest students decreased even though it was not eliminated.\n\nFigure 4.

When George Henry Alcock (1864\u20131941), a climber and mountaineer, visited the Cuillin in 1893, he wrote in his book Through the Highlands and Islands of Scotland:\n\nNo one who had not seen the Black Cuillin and the peculiar forms which the rocks assume would believe that nature could assume such strange shapes as are seen here. The first view of the Cuillin from the south makes them look like a huge fortress of rock, with fantastic turrets and chimneys, and battlemented walls.\n\n\nToday these classic features, viewed from the slopes of the nearby mountains of the mainland, such as the Beinn Eighe and M\xf2ine Mh\xf2r, have hardly changed. But the Cuillin are not just aesthetically pleasing. To their first British explorers in the mid-nineteenth century, the Black Cuillin, which form a massive ridge running from Coire an Lochain in Glen Brittle to An Dubh Sgeir, seemed a forbidding mountain barrier, \u2018a fortress of rock\u2019. Their modern reputation, and that of the smaller range of the Red Cuillin to the south-east, as a major challenge to both rock climbers and mountaineers, was established during the second half of the twentieth century. However, despite the presence of the two main ridges on the Black Cuillin (North-West Ridge and Central Ridge), many individual peaks, and the climbing routes up them, were relatively unexplored. This was to change in the 1970s and 1980s when many of the hard, mixed and winter routes, most of which were first climbed in the Cuillin, were recorded by enthusiastic pioneers. Today, climbing and scrambling in the Cuillin can be combined with hillwalking, and the varied routes, combined with the varied weather of Skye, offer an extremely satisfying and testing experience for a mountaineer.\n\nIn writing this guidebook, I have had to make many decisions regarding what routes to describe, and which to omit. Many climbers may not agree with my choices, and it is inevitable that a guidebook such as this will not be comprehensive. As well as describing my chosen routes, I have tried to include a range of other interesting aspects of the Cuillin, in order to make the book relevant to anyone interested in a mountaineering trip to Skye.\n\nGeology\n\nThe geology of Skye, and especially the Cuillin, is fascinating, and as well as a number of peaks and ridges, it has given rise to a series of dramatic glens, the upper parts of which are in the Inaccessible Pinnacle (Coire nam Bian) to the north of the main ridge. The Black Cuillin consist of metamorphic rocks which were formed as a result of a major mountain-building event in the Caledonian Orogeny, the mountain-building event which took place between 500 and 400 million years ago. At this time, a number of folds (anticlines and synclines) were formed, some of which can be seen today. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr, for example, was the result of the raising up of a syncline (Fig. 1). This event also resulted in the granite being exposed to the surface, but this did not happen everywhere. To the east of the island, most of Skye is underlain by metamorphic rocks, but to the west, particularly on the western coast of the Trotternish peninsula, granite is exposed. The Blue Stack is also part of a major fold which has resulted in the formation of the Trotternish Ridge.\n\nFigure 1. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr.\n\n\nThese major events have also resulted in a relatively complex geological map, with three main rock types (Fig. 2). A general layer of granite, called the Inaccessible Pinnacle Quartz Diorite, extends from the Blue Stack north-eastwards to Beinn Eighe. This granite has been intruded by the Red Cuillin Granite, which has a different composition and thus has different characteristics to the underlying rock. In the central and eastern parts of the main ridge of the Black Cuillin, the rocks are composed of the Papcastle Gneiss, which is a granitic metamorphic rock. However, to the west, around Sgurr nan Gillean and Glas Bheinn, the Papcastle Gneiss has been intruded by the Kintail Granite, giving rise to a more mottled appearance in this part of the Cuillin. A further complex of rocks is exposed on the north side of Glen Brittle, which includes the Torridonian Sandstone, Lewisian Gneiss, and Dalradian schists.\n\nFigure 2. Geology of Skye showing the main rock types.\n\n\nPeaks\n\nAs well as providing interest to geologists, the geomorphology of the Cuillin is also fascinating for climbers and walkers. With so many ridges and peaks, there is much to explore, and each summit offers its own rewards. Some of the individual peaks are not very high, but offer serious scrambles and rock climbs, while others, such as the highest summit of Sgurr nan Gillean (1,018 m) and the first major peak on the Central Cuillin Ridge, Sgurr Dearg (974 m), offer impressive views.

We have been searching for this lady for several days, and when the Herald office was last searched, we overlooked this message.\n\nAnother story of the stolen money says the woman, whose name is not given, gave the money to a young man who said he was a messenger from St. Catherine, and promised to deliver the money to the party it was addressed to at Kincardine.\n\nTHE MAYOR DISQUALIFIED\n\nA meeting of the citizens of Orangeville was held last Saturday evening at the Orangeville Town Hall, with Dr. A.

I want to get at the bottom of this business and find out who it was that drew up the notice of my being disqualified. I was the first one to speak in this town against the big sewer, but I am satisfied now that my opinions are shared by the majority.

The sky has always been full of questions. Our ability to dream big and speculate has enabled us to discover, theorize, and theorize even more. But where do we get the answers? These are the top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n10. Extraterrestrial Origin\n\nThe human race began to emerge from the Stone Age. The caves and forests were just getting familiar with the new inhabitants. There was a long time of fear and ignorance. Before we started to understand the world, they began to imagine what is outside the world. Some thought of creatures so powerful that they could destroy the world. Other speculated that we are a higher level of evolution and are the result of genetic experimentation of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nLater, these speculations were transformed into mythology and the imagination of the humans. In our modern world, it has turned into science. Many scientists still believe that we are not the only life in the universe and that at some point in history there was a connection with extraterrestrials. Some of them even believe that the first stages of our life were carried out with the help of aliens.\n\n9. Time Travel\n\nSince the beginning of history, people have always been fascinated with time. To travel back in time would allow us to explore the unknown, but would it be worth it? We live in a world where time is constant. Change is one of the most important principles of human life.\n\nNevertheless, many scientists still consider the possibility of time travel. The hypothetical method would be to build a giant machine that would make a hole in time. But how can this happen? It would involve breaking the speed of light and space.\n\nThe machine would have to be so big that it would create a massive black hole. Then the time machine would be moved into the center of the black hole, which would allow it to break the laws of time. So far, scientists have not been able to prove the validity of this theory.\n\n8. Time Travelers\n\nDespite the fact that time travel is still a hypothesis, there are people who believe that it is not. They claim to have traveled back in time to the present or to a previous generation. For this reason, there are also numerous stories about people who claim to have returned from the future to save the world.\n\nMost people who claim to have traveled back in time are just crazy. However, many scientists consider it possible that in the future, when we understand the laws of physics better, we may be able to travel through time. This possibility has been a mystery for a long time. So, this is a list of top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n7. Deja Vu\n\nThe theory of Deja Vu is so controversial that many scientists do not even dare to think about it. The definition of deja vu is, when a person experiences something, although he has never done it before. Many people think of it as a kind of visual hallucination. The most popular theory about the phenomenon is that it is a past memory that has not been triggered by the usual way.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the brain creates a fake memory to deceive the person who feels it. The theory is that in reality the person does not experience a deja vu, but it is an internal response to the same scenario. In short, the brain recognizes the environment and recognizes the story that it represents.\n\nIn this case, the illusion is that the person has lived through this scenario. Nevertheless, there are many people who do not think so. The reason is that deja vu is a phenomenon that occurs in any person. So, we have 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n6. Water World\n\nIt is one of the most popular theories in the world of science. It is believed that the moon is a result of a collision between the Earth and a body much larger than it. As a result of the collision, our planet was literally ripped. But what happened to the mass that fell on the surface? According to scientists, this part of the Earth remained liquid.\n\nThe evidence is so compelling that the theory of the water world has become a reality. For example, there is a large number of scientists who believe that the moon was the result of the Earth\u2019s rotation and gravitational collapse.\n\nMoreover, there are evidences that this theory may be true. For example, when scientists tried to drill in the Antarctic, they found water underneath. Also, according to many scientists, the planet Mercury, which has no magnetic field, may be the result of the remains of the water world.\n\n5]" time="0.405"><properties><property name="score" value="0.06907027" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[There are no spoilers in this review\n\nFrom the off, the third episode in the new Star Trek Discovery series has a slow pace.

Pictures. It is based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling. The film, which is the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter film series, was written by Michael Goldenberg and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.\n\nThe film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry\u2019s best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.\n\nThe story follows Harry\u2019s fifth year at Hogwarts as the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort\u2019s return. Harry must uncover the truth, with the help of his friends, and confront Voldemort.\n\nThe film began production in early 2007 and was released in theatres in the United Kingdom and United States on 12 July 2007, grossing a total of $292 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe film was nominated for two BAFTA Film Awards in 2008.\n\nFollowing a Harry Potter fan\u2019s dream that Harry\u2019s late headmaster Albus Dumbledore is alive, and in a critical condition at the Ministry of Magic, Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, decide to rescue him, as the school year comes to a close.\n\nOn the night of their attempt to break into the Ministry, Ministry of Magic employee Delores Umbridge slashes Rubeus Hagrid\u2019s hand with a knife, accusing him of stealing her kitten.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione fight the Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy and his son Draco both try to attack Harry, but he manages to save himself. Harry, Ron and Hermione get separated, and in the chaos, Ron manages to grab the prophecy from the Ministry\u2019s Hall of Prophecies.\n\nHarry and Hermione escape the Ministry, and Ron awakes to see Harry and Hermione\u2019s signatures on the prophecy, but does not know that Harry had ripped the prophecy out and left it in the hands of his godfather, Sirius Black, before he was killed.\n\nSirius, Harry, and Hermione head to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, where they meet with fellow members Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks, and Sirius\u2019s brother, Regulus.\n\nThe Order is joined by the regular adult wizards and witches in the battle, as Voldemort and his Death Eaters take over the Ministry of Magic and declare martial law on the entire Wizarding community.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore appears to die in battle, but this is revealed to be a ruse, as he and Severus Snape attack Voldemort and Lucius Malfoy, and attempt to take the prophecy from Ron. Lucius disarms Dumbledore, and an enraged Bellatrix kills him.\n\nBellatrix and Narcissa Malfoy stand by their husbands\u2019 sides. Albus Dumbledore\u2019s portrait is replaced with one of Snape. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rescued by Order members. Voldemort and the Death Eaters leave the Ministry.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione are told by Remus Lupin that all of the other Order members have been killed. Harry attempts to repair his damaged wand. He is visited by Snape, who tells Harry that the boy\u2019s wand is irreparably damaged and needs to be destroyed, as Voldemort has become aware that the wand is of a \u201cunique\u201d nature.\n\nThe two engage in a fierce duel in which Snape calls on his master to save him. Harry is unaffected by the curse due to his ability to cast a shield charm. He manages to shield himself and fight back, and in his distraction, Snape accidentally breaks his neck and dies.\n\nHarry meets with Dumbledore\u2019s portrait, who reveals to Harry that the boy\u2019s mother died to save him, and Harry is filled with his mother\u2019s love. Harry reveals that he feels angry and confused at this revelation.\n\nHarry also learns that the reason that Voldemort has gone to such great lengths to kill him is that Harry is a Horcrux, a piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul that resides in Harry\u2019s body.\n\nHarry then leaves Dumbledore\u2019s portrait and meets with Ron and Hermione, who have just been told that the students and staff are to evacuate the school, as the Death Eaters have declared that Hogwarts is no longer safe.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione are joined by Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and several other members of the Order of the Phoenix, and they apparate to 12 Grimmauld Place, the headquarters of the Order.\n\nThe Battle of the Department of Mysteries is followed by the Death Eaters taking over the Ministry of Magic, as they believe the prophecy to be a key to Voldemort\u2019s victory. Harry returns to Hogwarts to retrieve the prophecy from Voldemort.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione get ambushed by Death Eaters, and when Harry goes after the prophecies, he ends up dueling with Voldemort.\n\nHarry calls upon the remaining strength of his mother\u2019s love, and as Voldemort\u2019s Killing Curse rebounds upon him and hits Harry, the battle is ended, and the school is cleared of the Death Eaters.\n\nHarry wakes up to find Dumbledore, Sirius, and Remus in the hospital wing, as well as his friends and the rest of the school, and he realizes that he is safe.\n\nDumbledore then proceeds to give Harry his restored invisibility cloak, explaining to Harry that the Invisibility Cloak is one of the Deathly Hallows. Harry then says goodbye to his friends, as he leaves with Dumbledore to destroy the seven horcruxes that contain fragments of Voldemort\u2019s soul, which will make him immortal.\n\nThe film ends with Harry and Dumbledore leaving the school in a car, accompanied by Professor Minerva McGonagall.\n\nI liked this movie as it is full of action and adventure. The plot is great as well as the dialogue. It is a well made movie and it is very entertaining.\n\nThis movie is definitely a must-watch, as it has plenty of action as well as being very humorous.\n\nAdvertisements]" time="0.792"><properties><property name="score" value="0.00871626285" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00871626&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00871626

And people did not like that. I remember having this conversation where somebody said to me, \u2018When you are perceived as yourself, people have a hard time relating to that.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I think you are misperceiving yourself to be someone who has a choice.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying this like, \u2018Hey, world, my message is this, and you\u2019re going to like it.\u2019 That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about.

I\u2019ve got a bunch of kids and a beautiful girlfriend and a house that I love and that\u2019s not an accident.

But I would never want to turn my back on being a guitar player and a songwriter. And the reason why is because I have a fan base that loves me for being a guitar player and a songwriter, and it\u2019s very separate from the people who like my pop songs.&quot;\n\nHis Concert Review Regrets:\n\n&quot;I was like, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to be under these bright lights, and it\u2019s going to be this one moment in time where we\u2019re going to play it for you. And we want to give you the most you can get for your dollar.\u2019 And then I think I had a bad couple of years. And I lost myself and tried to get myself back, and now I\u2019m playing shows where, like, I\u2019m not having a good time.&quot;\n\nOn Live Music Criticism:\n\n&quot;I think we\u2019re overintellectualizing music. The discussion about music is so myopic and minuscule. \u2018He did this, and it\u2019s a disservice to this particular song.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, well, maybe you don\u2019t like this song. If you don\u2019t like it, just don\u2019t buy it. But that\u2019s not the way it works anymore. So I think we\u2019ve been eating the meat and spitting out the bones.

In the same style of mordant humor that makes &quot;The Ant and the Peacock&quot; one of the best-selling books on evolutionary biology, Kaplan and May delightfully explain why it's difficult for a scientist to break away from deeply ingrained habits of thought.\n\nThey also introduce the problem of citation errors--a problem that has become all too apparent in the aftermath of The Bell Curve, whose authors committed a blizzard of them, citing everything from studies that were never performed to nonexistent journals. Kaplan and May suggest ways to prevent citation errors and to identify them when they do occur. They reveal that it's possible to fabricate a scientific journal, and to fool people into believing it's real.\n\nBut they don't confine their attention to egregious examples of scientific malfeasance. On the contrary, &quot;The Art of Scientific Research&quot; is written as a series of serious and not-so-serious instructions on how to conduct research, how to get it published, and how to cite it accurately. There's even a section on the art of collaboration, complete with sage advice on how to make it work. &quot;The Art of Scientific Research&quot; is a book for anyone who does science, or wants to.]" time="0.298"><properties><property name="score" value="0.069214545" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.06921455&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.06921455

But just like the Browns have a way of winning the games they're supposed to, Fitzpatrick has a way of having performances like he did against the Browns last year.\n\nIt just happens in reverse.\n\nThe defense was ranked 30th in the league in pass defense and would give up more yards in the first quarter than in the entire game the year before, yet it's Fitzpatrick who throws for 5,367 yards and 40 touchdowns that year. That's not a typo. And it's not because he was the quarterback of the future and Josh Gordon was the No. 1 receiver of the future, either. (We'll ignore the fact that the Browns traded for Jason Campbell at the end of the season to play quarterback and traded away Trent Richardson for basically nothing.)\n\nFitzpatrick and the Browns were matched up against each other in the third week of the 2012 season, and by that point in the season Fitzpatrick had thrown for 4,008 yards and 27 touchdowns in just 12 games. He finished the season with an astronomical 8.18 yards per attempt, which was the highest in NFL history. (Since 2001, at least.) He averaged two touchdowns per game for the first three weeks of that season before throwing just five more in the final nine games.\n\nAnd that was in his first season with the Bucs. They acquired him on the last day of August, after he'd spent the last few months being cut and re-signed by the Bills, which was the latest example of the Bills treating him like a starting quarterback without actually starting him. When the Bucs traded for him, it was widely considered a sign that they'd be moving on from Josh Freeman, but Fitzpatrick's job was only to hold the fort. He didn't even start his first game until the Bucs' eighth game of the season.\n\nThis time around, Fitzpatrick is more than holding the fort. The Bucs have put him on the short list of best quarterbacks in the NFL, with his name appearing on every single MVP ballot last year, and after a few years of analysts treating him like a highly replaceable backup, he has emerged as a bonafide starter. And like most No. 1 quarterbacks, he also seems to thrive against certain teams.\n\nIt seems like a good rule of thumb to get out of the way when he's playing his best.\n\nThe Bucs will almost definitely start out slow against the Browns on Sunday, but they're not going to go through another slow start and blow a lead against the Browns for a second time. It just won't happen.\n\nThis is a different year, a different Browns team, and a different quarterback.

These ducks, according to the World Health Organization, most likely caught the virus from chickens, because H5N1-V has not previously been detected in wild birds, and H5N1 has not previously been found circulating among wild birds anywhere in the world. The two ducks apparently had not recently come into contact with any chickens. The H5N1-V strain found in the ducks is one of at least 14 genetically distinct H5N1 subtypes. While the H5N1-V strain can infect chickens, it cannot efficiently spread among them or to other species.\n\nH5N1 is an avian influenza virus, meaning that it naturally infects birds. Over the past 14 years, H5N1 has caused at least 555 infections and 282 deaths in humans. While those numbers are higher than any other human infection since influenza was first identified in humans in 1918, they are still a small fraction of the estimated 5 billion to 8 billion birds that have been infected with H5N1 over the past decade. The World Health Organization says that \u201cit is difficult to estimate accurately the number of cases that have gone undetected.\u201d Since the virus has spread to so many different countries, it is likely that many cases have gone undetected. Nevertheless, the case-fatality rate (defined as the percentage of people who die from a given disease) from H5N1 in humans is estimated at 60 percent. It is difficult to compare H5N1\u2019s case-fatality rate to those of other viruses. The case-fatality rate from the H1N1 influenza virus that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide, was only 2.5 percent, yet that virus killed about 2 percent of the world\u2019s population.\n\nGiven the high death toll, it is important to find the best ways to limit the spread of H5N]" time="0.307"><properties><property name="score" value="0.023710491" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.02371049&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.02371049

The author's descriptions of medications, both antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, are accurate and detailed. The reader can feel confident that the medication section is accurate, without the endless descriptions found in other books. The key point to remember is that the medications are not the &quot;cure&quot; for depression. Instead, they are used to provide a way of breaking through a &quot;state of learned helplessness&quot; and providing a method to help the patient engage in a treatment program. This is the key point in the book. In order to help those suffering with depression, Dr. Cohen believes that the medical profession has a responsibility to refer patients to a &quot;team&quot; which will help them get over their depression and learn to cope with the problem. This book will give the layperson a much-needed introduction to the field of depression, the various treatments, and how they work.

What's more, the recent natural gas pipeline explosion in California, which prompted a moratorium on new development, will exacerbate the problem.\n\nOver the next five years, the United States will have to import nearly half of the energy it uses, according to the most recent forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. As of now, the United States is the largest energy importer in the world, importing more energy than any other country. We import 3.5 million barrels of oil per day, and more than 80 percent of our oil comes from foreign countries. This puts us at the mercy of OPEC nations, and increasingly Russia, who we are now trying to court to invest in our own energy infrastructure.\n\nThis dependence is a matter of great concern for many energy analysts. Some say that it's time to cut our losses and invest in the most energy-efficient technology possible while we still can.\n\nOur continued dependence on foreign oil could have a long-term impact on the economy, they say, because the price of oil will continue to rise with the demand, and the price of energy could skyrocket in the next decade.\n\n'We Need to Start Thinking Now'\n\n&quot;Energy is not just a topic that's come up in the last few months,&quot; says Matthew Ranson, an analyst with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. &quot;It's been discussed in a serious way for decades now.&quot;\n\nAccording to Ranson, for a long time, people weren't really paying attention to energy issues in this country. But then, he says, &quot;the economy collapsed in the last year or so and the [energy] debate started up again in full force.&quot;\n\nBut even now, he says, &quot;we need to start thinking about it now. We can't just wait.&quot;\n\nThe economy will be hurt most by high energy prices, says Ranson. &quot;Energy, unlike other goods and services, is necessary for people to have jobs and make a living and grow the economy,&quot; he says.\n\nThe crisis is already in the works. &quot;Gas prices are expected to increase at the rate of $3 a year,&quot; Ranson says. &quot;At some point, it's going to make people reconsider car ownership, which we are seeing already.&quot;\n\nOther analysts have noted that the worst economic effects will come in the next few years as oil prices begin to hit consumers' wallets.\n\n&quot;It's really important for people to understand that we don't have to sit around and wait for it to hit us,&quot; Ranson says. &quot;We can do things now to change the way we make energy choices.&quot;\n\nThe United States needs to cut back on our reliance on oil, he says, and start developing clean, domestic energy resources like solar and wind power.\n\n&quot;We need to think differently about the choices that we're making,&quot; he says. &quot;If we have a choice to import oil from places that don't like us, or if we have a choice to invest in clean domestic energy that's good for us, we need to make the choice.&quot;\n\nThe Golden Years\n\nRanson admits that it's not going to be easy to move toward a clean energy economy. But there are things that can be done, such as improving efficiency and investing in new energy technologies. &quot;We can't do everything at once,&quot; he says.\n\nTo help reduce energy demand, Congress has passed a law to require the federal government to improve energy efficiency in its buildings.\n\nThere are also efforts under way to address the energy crisis in cities, where people can be more dependent on energy, according to Ranson.\n\n&quot;A lot of cities are thinking about this in different ways,&quot; he says. &quot;In New York, they're talking about ways to reduce car ownership, like getting people out of cars and into public transportation, making public transportation more convenient, and adding bike paths. You can start with that and see what happens.&quot;\n\nThe Natural Gas Supply\n\nAnother important energy issue to keep an eye on is the country's natural gas supply. Natural gas accounts for nearly 20 percent of the country's energy, and nearly 60 percent of the nation's electricity generation.\n\n&quot;We don't really have a clear understanding of how the supply of natural gas will be affected by what's going on in California,&quot; says Fred Millar, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank, Energy Security Initiative.\n\nMillar believes that the California situation may signal &quot;troubles ahead&quot; for the country's natural gas supply. &quot;There are real questions about how much natural gas is going to be produced by the industry in the coming years,&quot; he says.\n\nThere's been a dramatic drop in natural gas prices in the last few years, and that has encouraged a lot of companies to start new drilling operations, says Millar. But natural gas prices were going up last week, Millar says, and &quot;the question now is, has the bubble burst?&quot;\n\nA recent explosion at a Southern California natural gas pipeline, which took the lives of two workers, has put a halt to natural gas production in the state. The pipeline was owned by the Texas-based company Sempra Energy, and the blast occurred near Bakersfield. It is still unclear what caused the explosion.\n\nThe blast caused a temporary halt to the development of the Puente Valley Pipeline, a major new pipeline project.\n\nMillar says that the halt on the pipeline will have a major effect on the state's energy supplies. &quot;It could cause a major problem for California's electricity supplies,&quot; he says.\n\nMillar adds that the price of natural gas is likely to rise in the coming weeks and months because of the halt.\n\nOil and the Economy\n\nHigh energy prices are also a major concern for economists. &quot;The most immediate effect of a large price increase is inflation,&quot; says David Hughes, a geologist who has written extensively on energy issues. &quot;We can expect energy prices to increase for gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and other fossil fuels.&quot;\n\nBut economists are still debating how the economy will be affected. Some economists say that higher energy prices could have a positive impact on the economy, while others say the impact could be negative.\n\n&quot;It's too early to tell,&quot; says Millar. &quot;We're still in the stage where the price increases are in the process of playing out.&quot;\n\n&quot;The economy is more fragile than it was in the 1970s, and energy is more integrated into the economy, and prices are higher,&quot; says Ranson.\n\nBut he believes that the economy is better positioned to deal with energy prices now than it was in the 1970s. &quot;I don't think the impact of high energy prices will be nearly as bad this time,&quot; he says.\n\nA slowdown in the economy and a possible recession, Ranson says, could cause energy prices to spike even more.\n\nBut even if the economy takes a downturn, Ranson says that energy prices will keep going up. &quot;People may stop spending on some things,&quot; he says, &quot;but energy prices are going to keep going up.&quot;\n\nRanson says that people will have to make choices about how they live, and the government will have to decide how much of a subsidy it's willing to provide for the alternative energy industry.\n\nHughes believes that, ultimately, high energy prices will bring about some kind of economic crisis. &quot;In my view, this is a symptom of a much bigger problem, which is our oil-based economy,&quot; he says. &quot;We can no longer afford the fossil fuel based economy we have had for the past century.&quot;\n\nCopyright 2007 E&amp;E Publishing.

It was also near Gyeonghuigung. We walked up the hills near Gyeonghuigung, which were quite steep and also quite a nice walk. We also visited Seoul Tower which was lovely and there was a great view of Seoul.\n\nWe then travelled to Busan for a day to see the Ulsan Bijudong Cable Car and to take the ferry to Geoje Island.

We visited Hallasan Mountain and the Jeju Haenyeo Museum of Women\u2019s Contributions to Life in the Jeju Island in which there was a lovely view of Hallasan Mountain. We also visited Samcheok Beach. We had a great dinner at the Full Moon Hotel in the Samcheok Bay. There was a beautiful view of the moon rising over the beach from our room.\n\nThe next day, we went to Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, which was very beautiful. It is a volcanic crater on a small island that was completely formed from lava. It was cloudy and rainy while we were there. We went to Seogwipo and had a lovely lunch at Jin Jin Gop. We had a really nice seafood lunch and it was just a couple of minutes away from Seogwipo station. We went to the Seogwipo Lotte Shopping Center and bought some gifts.\n\nWe then went to Hallim Park.

We then went to Jeju Olle Trail which is a series of pathways that cross Jeju Island. They have been designed to showcase the most beautiful spots on Jeju. We went to the Jeju Olle trail which was near the entrance of Hallim Park. The weather was really nice so it was pleasant to be outside.\n\nWe went to Seongsan Sunrise Peak which was a nice place to see the sunrise. There was a really nice sunset too. The weather was very nice and it was a pleasant place to be. We also went to Mt Sine, which was very pretty. It was a bit foggy and we couldn\u2019t see Mt Halla but it was a nice walk. We also went to the 7 treasures of Jeju which was nice. We then went to Biyang-ri, Seogwipo, which was a bit more rural and very nice.\n\nOur last destination was the Jeju World Cup Stadium.

The kyat was introduced in 1923, replacing the Indian rupee which had been in use in Burma for about two centuries. One kyat is subdivided into 100 pyas, and one kyat is subdivided into 100 cents. Coins have been minted in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kyats, and 1, 5, 10 and 25 pyas, though the highest four denominations are rarely used.\n\nThe coins and notes currently in circulation are:\n\nBanknotes Coins\n\nKyat\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Kyat\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 Pyas\n\n1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 Cents\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Cents\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100\n\nCheck out the latest exchange rates!\n\nMyanmar Currency History\n\nDuring the last half of the 19th century, large quantities of Indian coins circulated in Burma. In 1885, Burma began to issue its own coinage, in a new decimal system. The rupee and the double rupee were equivalent to one kyat. These coins were not for circulation outside of Burma and were not legal tender in India. A similar coinage was issued in the last year of the 19th century, using slightly different weights and diameters for the three silver coins and for the copper coins.\n\nDuring World War I, the Burmese Government began issuing a series of paper notes for 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees. They were overprinted on banknotes of the Imperial Bank of India, the currency used for exchange in Burma until the mid-1930s.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the paper money of several countries was in circulation in Burma. Since the demand for small denomination notes was greatest, the British Government began to issue India notes in 1925. They were of low denomination, being in the denominations of 5, 10 and 20 rupees. The existing paper money was then demonetised.\n\nIn 1940, the Japanese occupied Burma and issued their own notes in place of the British issues. These notes continued to be in use until 1945, when the British re-established control of the country. In 1942, emergency notes were introduced, in the denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 rupees. These notes were overprinted on paper notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nIn 1946, a new series of notes was issued in Burma. This consisted of Indian notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India, overprinted B.E.P. and the State Bank of Burma. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees.\n\nThe present series of notes began in 1951. These notes are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 kyats.\n\nThe &quot;Burmese&quot; rupee, issued by the British between 1885 and 1896, was a fixed exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence (two and one-third rupees).\n\nThe U.S. dollar was established as the national currency of Burma in 1885 and is still the predominant currency in use in Myanmar.\n\nBanking in Myanmar\n\nMyanmar has an international banking system, with at least 7 major banks operating there. These include the state-owned Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and the private Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB), National Bank of Commerce (NBC), Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB), Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), Myanmar Mayflower Bank (MMB), Myanma Ahlia Bank (MAB), and Myanma Security Bank (MSB).\n\nMost commercial banks use the SWIFT system to transfer funds, and many banks in Myanmar accept electronic banking services through mobile phone banking, Internet banking, and ATMs. Some smaller banks still deal only in cash, but since cash is used mainly for larger transactions and shopping, and with so many ATMs in service now, it is no longer a problem.\n\n\n\nMyanmar currency info\n\nMyanmar info\n\nGuide to Myanmar\n\nCurrency information on country homepages]" time="0.351"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0232709" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.0232709&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.0232709

This report shows that anti-LGBT victimization in school is a serious problem for a large number of students. It also provides data on other forms of bullying and discriminatory treatment that LGBT students experience. Some of the findings of this report are particularly disturbing. For example, over half (53.1 percent) of LGBT students experienced feeling unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation, over one-quarter (26.1 percent) because of their gender expression, and over one-third (35.2 percent) because of both their sexual orientation and gender expression. This harassment and discrimination takes a toll on these students' well-being. The impact of the harassment and discrimination experienced by LGBT students is serious. LGBT students were more likely than non-LGBT students to report several adverse outcomes. For example, they were more likely than non-LGBT students to report high levels of depression (33.1 percent of LGBT students compared to 19.8 percent of non-LGBT students), to have seriously considered attempting suicide (32.2 percent of LGBT students compared to 13.2 percent of non-LGBT students), and to have made a suicide attempt (21.8 percent of LGBT students compared to 4.3 percent of non-LGBT students). Students who were more highly victimized were also more likely to experience these negative outcomes. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no anti-LGBT victimization, students who experienced a great deal of anti-LGBT victimization were more than three times as likely to have been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (10.0 percent compared to 3.6 percent), more than three times as likely to have been threatened or injured with a weapon off school property (14.7 percent compared to 4.3 percent), more than three times as likely to have experienced school violence (35.2 percent compared to 10.6 percent), more than four times as likely to have attempted suicide (25.0 percent compared to 5.7 percent), and more than six times as likely to have made a suicide attempt that required treatment from a doctor or nurse (10.4 percent compared to 1.8 percent).\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis report presents data from the National School Climate Survey (NCS), which collected data from over 7,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students ages 13\u201321 in public and private schools in every state and the District of Columbia during the spring of 2015. The report focuses on the experiences of LGBT students in public schools, but private school students' experiences are briefly discussed to provide context and additional information about the experiences of LGBT students in schools across the country.1 This report also includes a limited analysis of the data on the experiences of bisexual youth. This report provides the first national data on LGBT students' experiences in our nation's schools.\n\n\nLGBT students face a number of serious challenges at school, and this report provides a comprehensive look at the extent of the problem and its impact on LGBT students. Many LGBT students have experienced verbal harassment, physical assault, and sexual violence at school. For example, over half (53.1 percent) of LGBT students have felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, over one-quarter (26.1 percent) because of their gender expression, and over one-third (35.2 percent) because of both their sexual orientation and gender expression. In addition, over one-third (35.2 percent) of LGBT students have been verbally harassed and 19.6 percent have been physically attacked at school in the past year because of their sexual orientation or gender expression. These figures are even higher for transgender students: over half (53.8 percent) have felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression and over one-third (36.2 percent) because of their gender identity. Furthermore, over one-quarter (27.2 percent) of LGBT students have missed at least one entire day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable, and the prevalence of truancy increases further for transgender students: 40.1 percent of transgender students have missed at least one day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\n\nThis report also shows that the harassment and discrimination that LGBT students experience can lead to serious and negative outcomes for these students, including lower school engagement, lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and higher levels of depression and even higher levels of suicidal behavior. Over one-third (34.7 percent) of LGBT students reported missing school for at least one day during the month before the survey because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable. Students who experienced more victimization because of their LGBT status were also more likely to report this type of adverse outcome. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no victimization, students who experienced a great deal of victimization were almost four times as likely to have missed at least one day of school in the month before the survey because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable (45.6 percent compared to 12.3 percent).\n\n\nThe negative impact of this victimization on LGBT students can be seen in their reports of lower levels of engagement in school activities, lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and higher levels of depression. LGBT students who experienced high levels of victimization because of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or both were more likely than students who experienced low levels of victimization to feel that they could not be themselves at school (68.6 percent compared to 42.2 percent) and to feel unhappy or depressed at school (40.7 percent compared to 19.5 percent). Students who experienced high levels of victimization because of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or both were also more likely to report symptoms of depression than students who experienced low levels of victimization. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no victimization, students who experienced high levels of victimization were almost twice as likely to report feeling unhappy or depressed (38.7 percent compared to 20.2 percent) and almost three times as likely to report feeling less happy than other students (14.3 percent compared to 5.4 percent).\n\n\nData from the 2015 NCS show that many students still face serious and pervasive mistreatment and discrimination at school. These experiences can have a serious negative impact on students' well-being.

They\u2019re full of sweetness, heartache and inspiration \u2014 the kind that only music can provide.\n\nHere, Pollard reflects on the enduring and wonderful power of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\n\nOn being inspired by Bob Dylan\n\n\u201cHe made rock \u2018n\u2019 roll feel alive to me, you know? He just did things no one else was doing. The first time I heard his music, I was just in awe of it. I thought he was one of the only people doing something different in music and it really inspired me to make a rock band.\u201d\n\nOn working at Tower Records\n\n\u201cI worked at Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard in the Eighties. I was in a band that was signed to a major label and we were going to go on tour. We were going to make our first big move out to L.A. and the band broke up in Pittsburgh. I was heartbroken. I went to L.A. anyway and got a job at Tower and the band started to do really well in Pittsburgh. I started to realize that I was being a moron by working at a job that didn\u2019t have anything to do with music. I should have been playing music.\n\n\u201cThen, I met people that worked at the store \u2014 people that worked in the music section \u2014 and they were people that were into the same kind of music that I was. They were all very into the new wave thing that was going on at that time and I was very into the punk scene and I was discovering all this underground music. That was a good time because I was discovering so many great bands and all these great people.\u201d\n\nOn putting together Guided By Voices\n\n\u201cI was living in this little house on Cass Avenue in Detroit and I would just record these songs in the basement. I didn\u2019t think anyone would be interested. I just thought I was doing this for myself. Then, people started calling me and saying they wanted to play on the songs and asking if I could make copies of them. Eventually, I had enough to make a record. I was putting the band together around the same time.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, it was just one song. The whole point was to just have one song on a compilation of different artists from Michigan. That was the point of the whole thing. It was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s fun. That\u2019s really fun. Let\u2019s do another song.\u2019 It just became something else. Then, I started working with the other people. The other people were my friends. My friends were just my buddies that I\u2019d played music with. The first couple of years was just me and my buddies doing these songs. Then, it started to become a bigger thing and we started to tour and it became something else. It just turned into something else. It was an accident that it happened.\u201d\n\nOn his songwriting approach\n\n\u201cMy songs have always come from an unconscious, naive place. I really have to focus on a song and work on a song in order for it to have a definite melody or a definite idea. The words, I kind of write more like a novel and I try to write songs that work like a story. When I\u2019m doing them, I\u2019m trying to do it like a movie. I\u2019m trying to think of it in terms of a movie and I\u2019m trying to create characters and set the scenes and tell the story and make it a little bit deeper than what you would normally expect from a pop song. I\u2019m trying to take it to a different level in some ways. That\u2019s always been my goal and that\u2019s always been my style.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to reinvent the wheel, I just think that I\u2019m trying to take things that are already in existence and make them bigger and more beautiful and a little more complete. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really try to analyze it that much. I\u2019ve always written songs in the same way and the only thing that\u2019s changed is the way I record them. I used to record them all on a boombox and then, as we went along, we started to get more and more into studio work.\u201d\n\nOn recording songs at home\n\n\u201cI like to record in a place that\u2019s not a studio. I\u2019ve always liked to record in a place where I could have access to as much stuff as possible. I really enjoy it when I have a lot of cool things to play with. I always like to record at home. I think it\u2019s important to make the place you record at like a laboratory, you know? I like to have it be a lab. If I could, I\u2019d have every piece of equipment ever made and be able to put it all in one room and be able to experiment with every sound I could possibly make. It\u2019s so much fun and it\u2019s so much work at the same time, too. I love it.\u201d\n\nOn his songwriting process\n\n\u201cThe way I work, I just keep track of my thoughts and feelings. I think about it when I\u2019m walking or when I\u2019m eating or I\u2019m just doing stuff. I just keep track of stuff and I write down a lot of notes and I try to pay attention to things. My life is so boring, really, you know? I don\u2019t do anything that exciting. I just pay attention to things and I think about stuff and I write down little ideas. I do that all the time. I write little ideas all the time and I just try to remember them and try to put them in a folder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a filing system. The filing system is in my head. I try to remember everything I think about and I try to write it down and then, eventually, it becomes a song. Then, I try to look at the songs that are done and I try to pick the ones that seem to be the best and start thinking about them in terms of a story or a character or a scenario or something that would be entertaining. I have to think about all the things that are going on in my life and try to piece things together like a collage.\n\n\u201cThen, when it comes to the recording, I\u2019m thinking about the whole thing as a complete package. I\u2019m thinking about the sound of it and I\u2019m thinking about how I\u2019m going to mix the album and everything. I\u2019m thinking about the lyrics and the voice. Everything is kind of part of a bigger thing and the sound and the performance is really important.\u201d\n\nOn keeping it simple\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to write when you\u2019re just keeping it simple. When you start to complicate things, it becomes too big of a thing to think about. That\u2019s when the song becomes too precious and you can\u2019t finish it or you start getting scared of it or something like that. Then, you get caught up in the emotion of it and you can\u2019t do it. You have to remember that it\u2019s just something you\u2019re doing to pass the time. It\u2019s just something you\u2019re doing for fun. That\u2019s what it is for me. It\u2019s just fun. I\u2019m not trying to be any big shot or anything like that. I\u2019m just trying to do something that\u2019s fun and I\u2019m just trying to make something that\u2019s going to give me some satisfaction. I\u2019m just trying to do something that\u2019s going to be fun to listen to and fun to make.\u201d\n\nOn his songwriting being like therapy\n\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m not trying to be a serious writer or anything like that. I\u2019m not trying to be pretentious at all. I just want to make a record that I\u2019d like to listen to.\u201d\n\nOn the joy of performing\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling, you know? There\u2019s something very satisfying about it. You just can\u2019t stop it, you know? I\u2019ve been doing it for so long and it just doesn\u2019t go away. You can\u2019t stop it. I just keep on doing it and I can\u2019t stop it. I think that\u2019s the reason why I do it, you know?\u201d\n\nOn discovering The Beatles\n\n\u201cThe Beatles made]" time="0.660"><properties><property name="score" value="0.172153851" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.17215385&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.17215385

What happens when you decide to make a new product and to have a bigger impact? You might think that you have to start with an already existing product and create something new. But this is not always true.\n\nSometimes you need to start from scratch and create something new \u2013 a new form, a new material, new applications or new customer experiences. This is what happened when Ikea created the L\xd6MSK light collection \u2013 a range of products made of plaster and leather, using two materials that we usually associate with other products.\n\nL\xd6MSK: it\xb4s easy being a one-of-a-kind light\n\nTwo elements were the starting point of the L\xd6MSK light collection: an existing material and a very unusual use for it. Plaster and leather are very traditional materials that are linked to very different products. We know plaster for its use in wallpapers, ceilings and sculptures, but it is not very common to use it in products such as lights or furniture. Leather has a much stronger association with leather goods, clothes, bags or shoes. And in fact, leather is one of the most used materials in the furniture industry.\n\nTwo products, plaster and leather, that are very common to different types of industries but never used together.\n\nIkea wanted to combine these two materials in a collection of lights, lamps and other decorative elements, in order to make a complete lighting system that can be easily incorporated into any interior and made more personal.\n\nA creative team started exploring ways of using these two materials in a complete lighting collection. They started experimenting with different elements such as the light bulb and the suspension, to combine them and to make sure they can adapt to the maximum number of situations. The development of the light was not a process of making a more perfect product, but rather a process of exploring new ways of using existing products.\n\nAs a result, they developed three series of products. One made of plaster and leather, and two others made of plaster. The leather light is one of the most surprising elements in the collection, as it is hard to believe that this kind of leather is the same that we see in jackets or shoes.\n\nThe leather used in the light is dyed in different colours in order to add interest to the design and it is used to create the \u201cU\u201d shape that holds the light bulb. This element was designed to be a flexible element in the light, allowing the user to change the direction of the light and adapt it to different uses.\n\nFinally, the leather light can also be suspended with a wire, making it ideal for reading lights.\n\nThe second series, made of plaster, is the plateroom series, and the third series is a collection of lamps made of plaster with different shades. The aim was to use plaster to make different types of lamps that can adapt to the different sizes of space. This is achieved by combining the plaster with different shades and creating elements such as the plateroom bench and the plateroom table, with different dimensions and shades.\n\nThere is an important message that Ikea wants to communicate with this collection: that it is possible to create something new and original.\n\nYou need to start with something simple but at the same time creative and unusual. This is what Ikea wants to achieve with this collection: creating a new product that is easy to understand and appreciate, but at the same time has an innovative design and can be used in different types of interior.\n\nThis can be achieved by starting with a very simple element and having an open mind, as the designers did with this collection. Ikea has created a very unusual product that is adaptable to different situations and can be adapted to any kind of interior or architecture.]" time="0.350"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0032056293" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Jubal Early\n\nJubal Anderson Early (July 14, 1816July 2, 1894) was a Confederate general in the American Civil War and a politician after the war. Although he served almost the entire war in the eastern theater, his most significant contributions were in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, which ended in the stalemate at Petersburg, Virginia, and the capture of the Union garrison at Lynchburg, Virginia. Early is considered among the best Confederate generals who never served in the Army of Northern Virginia.\n\nEarly was born in Southampton County, Virginia, the seventh of ten children of Ruth (Anderson) Early and Judge John Early, a former governor of Virginia and member of the United States Congress. In 1825, Early attended Charlotte Hall Military Academy. He graduated second in his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1838, placing him above such future generals as Stonewall Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nEarly was appointed a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. He served as an aide to General Winfield Scott in the War with Mexico and fought in the Battle of Molino del Rey and the Battle of Chapultepec. Early served as the acting chief of artillery in the assault on the city of Mexico, and received two brevets for his bravery in these battles. He was one of the first officers to enter Mexico City, and he served as an artillery instructor at West Point from 1847 to 1852. Early served as a major in the United States Army in the Seminole Wars in 1855, and as a captain in the United States Dragoons in 1858.\n\nEarly entered the Virginia Military Institute in 1852, and became a professor of mathematics at the Institute, where he taught until the Civil War. He was known for his severity as a disciplinarian. Early became known as a superb military tactician and administrator, as well as an able administrator and strategist.\n\nIn 1860, Early entered politics, running as a Democrat for one of the two seats in the Virginia House of Delegates from Southampton County, but he was defeated. The state seceded from the Union on April 17, 1861, and Early was commissioned as a colonel of artillery in the Virginia militia on May 14. When Virginia militia units were activated for Confederate service, Early was appointed a brigadier general of Virginia forces on May 27.\n\nEarly initially commanded a brigade in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett. When Garnett died at the Battle of Mill Springs, Early was promoted to brigadier general on January 16, 1862. His brigade was assigned to Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith's division in the Army of Northern Virginia. Early fought in the Peninsula Campaign, including the Siege of Yorktown, during which his brigade was an important factor in repulsing a Union assault on the right flank of the Confederate entrenchments at Savage's Station. Early received praise for his actions at Hanover Court House.\n\nEarly distinguished himself during the Seven Days Battles. He received his commission as a major in the Confederate Regular Army on June 9, 1862, but was later returned to his previous rank of colonel in the reserves. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, he received plaudits for his actions at the Second Battle of Bull Run.\n\nEarly was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate regular army on October 11, 1862. He was given command of a brigade in Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division of A.P. Hill's III Corps. During the Maryland Campaign, Early performed well at the Battle of South Mountain.\n\nDuring the Battle of Fredericksburg, Early was severely wounded in the right thigh and temporarily assigned to administrative duties. He returned to the field in time to defeat Union Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's offensive at the Battle of Chancellorsville. At Chancellorsville, Early performed ably in combat and earned praise for his conduct as a brigade commander. Early was sent to western Virginia, where he defeated Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans at the Battle of Mill Springs. After Chancellorsville, Early was promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier general in the Confederate Regular Army on May 21, 1863, and given command of a division.\n\nEarly fought under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Early's old brigade was reassigned to Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson. The Second Battle of Kernstown was his most significant contribution during the Valley Campaigns. Following the Valley Campaigns, Early was assigned to Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge's command in the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nHe conducted the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Following Early's victory at the Battle of Lynchburg in June 1864, Early's army became separated by Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter's raid. Hunter's force was driven from the Valley in the Battle of Lynchburg by Early's troops. During the Valley Campaigns, Early defeated Union Maj. Gen. George Crook at the Battle of Rutherford's Farm and the Battle of Tom's Brook, drove Maj. Gen. David Hunter from the Valley in the Second Battle of Kernstown, and defeated Union Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan at the Third Battle of Winchester.\n\nEarly defeated Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter's Valley Campaign in the Second Battle of Kernstown in July 1864. He then crossed into Maryland and threatened Washington, D.C., forcing Grant to send reinforcements to the capital area. During the subsequent Valley Campaigns of 1864, Early defeated Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan at the Battle of Opequon, the Third Battle of Winchester, and the Battle of Fisher's Hill. Sheridan's victory at the Battle of Cedar Creek forced Early to retreat back to the Valley.\n\nEarly was assigned to the Department of the West and ordered to reinforce the Confederate Army of Tennessee, but Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge convinced him to resist Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's advance. At the beginning of the Atlanta Campaign, Early was given command of the newly created Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee. During the Battle of Resaca, he launched an unsuccessful assault against a Union fortification on the western bank of the Oostenaula River, suffering heavy casualties. During the subsequent battles of Adairsville and Cassville, his corps attempted to flank Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's left flank, but his subordinates were slow in attacking and failed to coordinate their movements with other Confederate forces. After the Confederates suffered defeat at the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Early retreated with his corps to Lovejoy's Station. He ordered Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham's division to open the Battle of Atlanta by attacking the Union force under Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. Early was in the town of Marietta when he learned that Lt. Gen. John B. Hood was wounded during the Battle of Atlanta, and he returned to Atlanta to take command of the army.\n\nDuring the subsequent Siege of Atlanta, the Army of Tennessee lacked provisions and was forced to withdraw from Atlanta. The army was defeated during the subsequent pursuit, and Early's corps was heavily engaged at the Battle of Ezra Church. In November 1864, the Army of Tennessee was reorganized and Early was given command of the new Second Corps. At the Battle of Franklin, he was killed by a shot through the heart, and his corps suffered significant casualties. The Second Corps was commanded by Maj. Gen. William B. Bate after Early's death. Bate was also wounded and captured, and the corps was virtually destroyed. Bate's capture led to another shakeup of the army's command structure, and Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart assumed command of the Second Corps.\n\nEarly was buried at the Old Methodist Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia, but the cemetery closed and his remains were moved to Richmond National Cemetery.\n\nThe Virginia Historical Society operates the Jubal Early Memorial Cemetery near New Market, Virginia, where he is buried.\n\nEarly was known as &quot;Old Jubal&quot; to his men and &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; to his friends. Confederate General Robert E. Lee was a friend of Early's, and named his youngest son, Jubal Anderson, after him.\n\nIn the film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, Early was portrayed by actor Martin Sheen. The movie presented Early as a vain, glory-seeking but weak commander who bickered with fellow Confederate generals Joseph E. Johnston and James Longstreet over who was in command of the Army of Tennessee.\n\nHe is also featured in Jeff Shaara's &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; trilogy, where he is portrayed by Jon Voight.\n\nThe James River Squadron was a Confederate Navy organization during the American Civil War which operated on the James River, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n]" time="0.643"><properties><property name="score" value="0.5225493513333334" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.52254935&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.52254935

He is popularly known as the father of the profession and he was born in Paris, the son of Pierre Le N\xf4tre, a painter of miniatures and Marie Le N\xf4tre. He was trained in his fathers occupation, he did some paintings by the time he was sixteen. He travelled to Italy with Pierre Berchet in 1640, and worked with the architect Jacques Lemercier, from 1646 he was occupied with architectural drawing for the Louvre. He was made a member of the Acad\xe9mie at Mans in 1650, Le N\xf4tres first known landscape project was at the ch\xe2teau of Vaux-le-Vicomte, for his distant relative, Nicolas Fouquet. Here he was more open to the imagination, transforming the plan into a Picturesque and Romantic garden. His work showed a tendency towards the natural and asymmetrical, Le N\xf4tre was unable to visit Italy on account of wars with the Italian states. His influence was limited to parts of the northeast of France, Le N\xf4tres first projects in this style were done for the court of the prince de Cond\xe9. The ch\xe2teau of Chantilly, belonging to the princess of Cond\xe9, Fran\xe7ois, Le N\xf4tre achieved the most at the Ch\xe2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, for Louis XIV and his duc de Bourgogne, later the duc dOrl\xe9ans. Le N\xf4tre created a estate at Marly, and, at the Trianon, for the young Louis XIV. His work transformed the old fort into a palace, more suitable for the residence of the king. He is also responsible for the landscapes of the gardens of the Ch\xe2teau de Maisons and Ch\xe2teau de Saint-Cloud, Le N\xf4tre died in 1681, and was succeeded by his son Jean-Charles Le N\xf4tre, to whom he had taught his encyclopedic style, and his son-in-law Fran\xe7ois Dunan. The design of the gardens of the Ch\xe2teau de Marly was a project of Le N\xf4tres. They were designed to be seen from the top of the terrace, the perspectives and size of the gardens were calculated to surprise the spectators. Le N\xf4tre planned the gardens following the Renaissance principles of regularity, symmetry and he was also responsible for the modifications made to the original plan, done by Charles Le Brun and the gardener Martin Charbonnier, who remade the terrace and the parterres. The final result was the ancestor of modern formal gardens, in 1660 and 1661, Le N\xf4tre built two mansions on the Place Royale in Paris, for the jewellers Louis de Lancy and Balthazar Claquin. In 1664, Le N\xf4tre and Claude Perrault collaborated on a project for the west side of the Louvre. Le N\xf4tres last landscape was the garden around the ch\xe2teau de Sceaux, a project which was incomplete at the time of his death in 1681\n\n9. Gardens of Versailles \u2013 The Gardens of Versailles occupy part of what was once the Domaine royal de Versailles, the royal demesne of the ch\xe2teau of Versailles. Situated to the west of the palace, the gardens cover some 800 hectares of land, in addition to the meticulous manicured lawns, parterres of flowers, and sculptures are the fountains, which are located throughout the garden. Dating from the time of Louis XIV and still using much of the network of hydraulics as was used during the Ancien R\xe9gime. On weekends from spring to early autumn, the administration of the museum sponsors the Grandes Eaux \u2013 spectacles during which all the fountains in the gardens are in full play. In 1979, the gardens along with the ch\xe2teau were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, one of thirty-one such designations in France. With Louis XIII\u2019s final purchase of lands from Jean-Fran\xe7ois de Gondi in 1632 and his assumption of the role of Versailles in the 1630s. Records indicate that late in the decade Claude Mollet and Hilaire Masson designed the gardens and this early layout, which has survived in the so-called Du Bus plan of c.1662, shows an established topography along which lines of the gardens evolved. This is evidenced in the definition of the main east-west. From this point forward, the expansion of the gardens of Versailles followed the expansions of the ch\xe2teau, accordingly, Louis XIVs building campaigns apply to the gardens as well. At every stage the prescribed tour was managed, under the Sun Kings directions. First building campaign In 1662, minor modifications to the ch\xe2teau were undertaken, existing bosquets and parterres were expanded and new ones created. Most significant among the creations at this time were the Orangerie, the Versailles Orangery, which was designed by Louis Le Vau, was located south of the ch\xe2teau, a situation that took advantage of the natural slope of the hill. It provided an area in which orange trees were kept during the winter months. The Grotte de Th\xe9tys, which was located to the north of the ch\xe2teau, formed part of the iconography of the ch\xe2teau, the grotto would be completed during the second building campaign. By 1664, the gardens had evolved to the point that Louis XIV inaugurated the gardens with the f\xeate galante called Les Plaisirs de l\u2019\xcele Enchant\xe9e. The event, which officially was to celebrate his mother, Anne d\u2019Autriche, guests were regaled with fabulous entertainments in the gardens over a period of one week. As a result of this f\xeate \u2013 particularly the lack of housing for guests, Louis realized the shortcomings of Versailles and began to expand the ch\xe2teau and the gardens once again. With this new phase of construction, the gardens assumed the topographical and iconological design vocabulary that would remain in force until the 18th century. \u201d\n\n10. French language \u2013 French is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages, French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues do\xefl\u2014languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to Frances past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, a French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French. French is a language in 29 countries, most of which are members of la francophonie. As of 2015, 40% of the population is in Europe, 35% in sub-Saharan Africa, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas. French is the fourth-most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union, 1/5 of Europeans who do not have French as a mother tongue speak French as a second language. As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 17th and 18th century onward, French was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa, most second-language speakers reside in Francophone Africa, in particular Gabon, Algeria, Mauritius, Senegal and Ivory Coast. In 2015, French was estimated to have 77 to 110 million native speakers, approximately 274 million people are able to speak the language. The Organisation internationale de la Francophonie estimates 700 million by 2050, in 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese. Under the Constitution of France, French has been the language of the Republic since 1992. France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education except in specific cases, French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland called Romandie, of which Geneva is the largest city. French is the language of about 23% of the Swiss population. French is also a language of Luxembourg, Monaco, and Aosta Valley, while French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands. A plurality of the worlds French-speaking population lives in Africa and this number does not include the people living in non-Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language. Due to the rise of French in Africa, the total French-speaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050, French is the fastest growing language on the continent. French is mostly a language in Africa, but it has become a first language in some urban areas, such as the region of Abidjan, Ivory Coast and in Libreville. There is not a single African French, but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages, sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth\n\n11. Garden \u2013 A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials, the most common form today is known as a residential garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one.

They argued that residents in the water districts that purchase the water were being punished for water overuse by residents of Pueblo and Pueblo County, even though they don\u2019t buy the water.\n\nThe Pueblo County commissioners sent a letter to CSWW last month that said, in part: \u201cWe do not consider that the Pueblo Reservoir can be drained without impact to the water service area, and it is our position that this is discriminatory.\u201d\n\nThe commissioners sent another letter Tuesday saying the county is committed to working with the Colorado Springs Water Works on this issue and future water issues.\n\nCSWW agreed to issue a second letter to water districts in Pueblo and Pueblo County clarifying that water would be available.\n\nThe districts that had been receiving water have already begun taking the water again, said Dennis Tenorio, general manager of the Northern Water Users Association.

It would also help the prime minister gain influence with a parliament elected in April.\n\nLawmakers met Monday afternoon in a closed session to hear from the prime minister and approve the new Cabinet.\n\nIraqi lawmakers already have approved acting ministers in the foreign and defense portfolios in anticipation of a new Cabinet.\n\nThe proposed new defense minister is Khaled al-Obeidi, the chief of staff of the armed forces.\n\nThe candidate for the interior portfolio is Mohammed al-Ghabban, an official in the predominantly Shiite paramilitary forces known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.

I\u2019ve now had the second generation of the iPod nano for about a week and wanted to give you my thoughts about it.\n\n(Last Updated: Nov 12th, 2012)\n\nThe Physical Design\n\nI think Apple got this design right with the nano. It\u2019s very thin and light, which I like. It\u2019s almost identical to the 1st gen nano, but thinner, and with a larger screen. The big deal for me is that it is so much thinner and smaller than the previous nano. I don\u2019t know why I like that so much, but it does make it so much easier to carry around.\n\nThe Screen\n\nI was initially concerned about the small size of the screen. My fear was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see the screen as well, or that it would be harder to navigate the menus. I\u2019m very happy to report that the screen size is perfect for what I want. I think the new screen is just large enough to easily navigate menus and change songs.\n\nThe Sound Quality\n\nI was very skeptical about the new sound quality. I don\u2019t have a lot of time to listen to music, and when I do, I usually do it while at the gym. So for me, sound quality is not a huge priority, but I was concerned about it with the new nano.\n\nWell, I am very happy to say that the sound quality is much better than the first generation nano. It is not better than my 4th gen iPod touch, but it is about the same, and sounds really good to me.\n\nThe Battery Life\n\nThe battery life of the new nano is what I was most worried about. The previous nano only got about 5 hours of battery life when playing music, and this is the same battery as the first generation nano. But I was pleasantly surprised by the new nano. It only lasts about 8 hours, but that\u2019s fine for me. My goal is to carry a nano that can give me 8 hours of listening time at the gym. The only time I need longer than that is when I\u2019m traveling for work, and I have my iPhone with me for music.\n\nThe Software\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into too much detail here, but I am very happy with the new software. I think the new interface looks great and I love that I can easily make the album art fit the screen perfectly.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I\u2019m very happy with the new iPod nano 2G. It is the perfect size and weight for me. It sounds good, and the battery life is good enough for me. It\u2019s nice to have an iPod that\u2019s small enough to fit in my pocket.\n\nI would definitely recommend the new iPod nano. If you already have a 1st gen nano, the only reason to upgrade is for the size.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, is that Apple has said that]" time="0.294"><properties><property name="score" value="0.010525251" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Advanced Biological Warfare (ABW)\n\nThere is an urgent need for &quot;offensive&quot; biological warfare (BW) capability, to complement defensive measures against an attack with biological weapons (BW). Existing defensive measures provide only limited protection against BW, and their usefulness would be significantly reduced in some circumstances. No acceptable defenses have been developed against BW agents.\n\nThis lack of adequate defenses against biological weapons is a major vulnerability in the security of the United States. The increasing danger that biological weapons will be used for hostile purposes poses an urgent need to counter the threat.\n\nModern biological warfare could include development and use of pathogenic organisms and toxins, as well as incapacitating agents. The former might well be the only BW agent of concern because of their potential for causing mass casualties.\n\nThe widespread use of modern technology has increased the availability of biological materials for use as BW agents. Current medical knowledge has increased the potential to create and spread biological weapons. This trend is expected to continue.\n\nEarly development and testing of a pathogenic agent for use in an offensive BW program would not be easily detectable. A biological agent can be disseminated in many ways and to many places with little warning. It is difficult to effectively monitor, detect, and decontaminate a wide area after an attack.\n\nStrategic Offensive Biological Warfare\n\nStrategic offensive BW provides the United States with a major deterrent against potential adversaries. As a deterrent weapon, strategic offensive BW can have a significant impact on the overall military posture of the United States and its potential adversaries. It is in the national interest of the United States to develop a military biological capability to deter an adversary from using biological weapons.\n\nStrategic offensive BW will be used against enemy personnel or facilities to inflict maximum casualties, degrade military capability, or destroy life-sustaining resources or capabilities. In military operations, strategic offensive BW would be used as part of a coordinated effort, in conjunction with other conventional and nuclear forces, and it would require integration of tactical, operational, and strategic capabilities.\n\nStrategic offensive BW could be employed by the United States to complement and support its defensive and non-military (e.g., diplomatic, political, economic, and legal) measures in the event of a biological attack. Its primary purpose would be to minimize the impact of a biological attack on the United States or its forces. Strategic offensive BW may also have applications in countering adversaries that are seeking to develop and maintain a BW capability.\n\nNon-Strategic Offensive Biological Warfare\n\nNon-strategic offensive BW may be employed in support of specific military operations against specific adversary targets. It may also be used in support of other military operations. It would be used to complement and support defensive and non-military measures in the event of a biological attack.\n\nNon-strategic offensive BW would be limited in scope and duration, but it would still be considered offensive because it would result in the infliction of casualties. Non-strategic offensive BW would be used against specific targets, rather than against a large area. It would normally be employed in peacetime as a form of anticipatory self-defense, rather than as a weapon of last resort. Non-strategic offensive BW could be conducted clandestinely to avoid a general war.\n\nThe possession of non-strategic offensive BW capabilities would enhance the deterrent posture of the United States. It would enhance US options to counter biological threats. These options include military action and other non-military actions, which could preclude the need for a military response.\n\nThe National Military Strategy (NMS) endorses non-strategic offensive BW as a credible deterrent to aggression against US interests. The NMS identifies two levels of non-strategic offensive BW for deterrence: A highly credible threat to use BW agents in response to biological attacks or a threat to use BW agents in response to a biological attack. The NMS also identifies a low-level but still credible threat to use BW agents to counter limited biological attacks, sabotage, and hostage-taking.\n\nGlobal Issues\n\nThe US BW program is important to national security and international stability. A fundamental premise of US policy is that offensive BW capabilities are legitimate instruments of national power, especially if the United States is threatened by chemical or biological weapons. The United States has an interest in dissuading the proliferation of BW programs. The development of offensive capabilities by countries without chemical or biological weapons programs or doctrines would be destabilizing and increase the likelihood of their use. The growth of indigenous BW programs in countries with other WMD programs would have similar destabilizing effects.\n\nInternational stability is jeopardized when there is uncertainty as to whether nations will abide by international legal commitments regarding BW. The US BW program is not intended to influence foreign countries, but to demonstrate the US commitment to deter the use of biological weapons and to respond if deterrence fails. BW will be maintained as a credible deterrent, but not one that would have to be used. The United States should make clear its continued intention to pursue an effective BW program to deter adversaries, if necessary.\n\nUS non-strategic offensive BW is an important element of national power and US leadership in arms control. The US BW program plays a crucial role in US leadership in arms control. Non-strategic offensive BW is necessary for full compliance with existing and emerging arms control and non-proliferation agreements. It is important for successful implementation of the CWC, the BWC, and other regional and international agreements. This would prevent the proliferation of BW programs in countries with other WMD programs.\n\nInterdiction\n\nThe inherent characteristics of biological agents make them suitable for clandestine delivery and easy to disseminate. Biological agents could be delivered clandestinely to specific personnel or facilities in areas under control of a potential adversary, without risk to the agents\u2019 handlers.\n\nThe ability of an adversary to clandestinely deliver a biological agent makes the effectiveness of a traditional containment strategy, such as is used in the management of nuclear, chemical, and missile proliferation, problematic. A defensive strategy for biological weapons will have limited utility.\n\nInterdiction of a clandestine BW attack would require significant intelligence resources and considerable time. It would be difficult to find the attacking agent, assess the magnitude of the attack, and identify the source of the attack. If it is found, the agents are difficult to detect and are difficult to destroy. In the unlikely event that a clandestine BW attack were detected and stopped before any damage occurred, the United States would have to consider the political and military implications of conducting an extensive search for the source of the BW attack.\n\nIf an adversary does attempt to use BW, the United States would have to consider the implications of an extensive search for the source of the attack, whether it should be attempted, and what political and military actions might result. US policy is to discourage development of BW programs in countries without other WMD programs, but to take BW programs in friendly countries into account. Therefore, the United States would have to consider how the public and international community would react to the use of US resources to search for a biological attack.\n\nBiological Weapons Control\n\nUnited States policy is to discourage countries from developing and using BW and to discourage the proliferation of BW.\n\nThe United States wants to minimize the risk of WMD proliferation and to prevent or mitigate the harmful consequences of proliferation. Because BW programs are easier to develop and conceal than are nuclear, chemical, and missile programs, US policy is to take appropriate measures to minimize the risk of proliferation of BW. In the case of US friends and allies, it will consider the importance of the BW program to the defense of the country and its overall relations with that country.\n\nBiological weapons could be used in conjunction with nuclear, chemical, or other weapons. This possibility increases the potential threat posed by BW. The United States has concluded that the worldwide prohibition of BW would not eliminate the threat of their use. Although the worldwide elimination of BW is a long-term goal, there is no realistic means to reach it in the foreseeable future. The United States will continue to work toward that goal, but in the meantime it will maintain an effective BW deterrent.\n\nFormal arms control, including international verification of BW programs, would not be sufficient to prevent the clandestine development and use of BW. Biological weapons can be developed and used without a massive infrastructure. Interdiction of clandestine BW programs may not be successful. A country with both BW and chemical weapons programs would be able to attack with biological weapons without any risk of exposure of its chemical weapons program. The United States will seek to work with friendly countries to prevent proliferation of BW.\n\nThe United States would oppose a global ban on the development, possession, or use of BW because it is not a realistic possibility. Such a ban would not eliminate the threat of BW. It would be easy to evade a ban and difficult to enforce.\n\nThe United States will continue to work with the international community to reach an effective and acceptable solution to the BW problem.\n\nTechnical Issues\n\nThe United States does not want to be vulnerable to BW, and it must be able to meet the challenge of a biological attack. However, the US BW program will not be capable of protecting the United States against a chemical or nuclear attack, nor will it be able to protect against all types of biological weapons.\n\nThere is no defense against BW. The United States does not want to be vulnerable to BW. However, if an adversary did use BW, the United States would be willing to use its offensive BW capability to counter it.\n\nThere are no weapons systems or defensive measures capable of protecting against all types of biological warfare. However, a significant deterrent can be developed to dissuade potential adversaries from using BW. This would require BW programs to develop and maintain a viable capability to inflict casualties, degradation of military capability, or destruction of life-sustaining resources or capabilities.\n\nThe likelihood that a biological attack would be effective is low. The impact of biological weapons would be low compared to that of nuclear, chemical]" time="1.024"><properties><property name="score" value="0.04253287333333333" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[University of Notre Dame Australia\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Australia (formerly Notre Dame University) is an Australian Roman Catholic university established in 1989. The main campus is located at the northern end of the Monash Freeway in Craigieburn, 25 kilometres north-west of the Melbourne central business district in Victoria, Australia. The university has approximately 1,800 students.\n\nNotre Dame Australia is a tertiary institution of the Congregation of Holy Cross, a religious community of priests and brothers founded in 1837 in Le Mans, France by Father Pierre Coudrin. The Congregation of Holy Cross was formally recognised by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. In Australia the Congregation of Holy Cross established the predecessor of Notre Dame University, the Holy Cross College, at Box Hill, Victoria in 1951. Holy Cross College was incorporated as a company in 1978 and was approved by the Victorian Government as a Catholic University College in 1981.\n\nIn January 1989 the Holy Cross College and the St. Columba's Church in Bulla moved to new premises in Craigieburn. At that time the college was renamed as the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts and the College of Commerce, Science and Technology.\n\nIn 1991 the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts, the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts (Interim), the College of Commerce, Science and Technology and the Holy Cross Seminary amalgamated to become a university college.\n\nIn 1994 the Notre Dame College of Education and the College of Science amalgamated to become the Notre Dame College of Education and Science.\n\nIn 1996 the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts was amalgamated with the College of Education and Science.\n\nIn 1997 the University of Notre Dame Australia was formally established.\n\nIn 2003 the university changed its name from the University of Notre Dame Australia to Notre Dame University Australia. The change in name reflected the development of the university's research and postgraduate research and development capabilities.\n\nIn 2005 the university changed its name back to the University of Notre Dame Australia.\n\nThe university's crest was designed by Michael Malone of Pentagram, Melbourne, and is based on the &quot;Cross of the Holy Spirit&quot;, which was designed by Leonard McCoy of the University of Notre Dame, in the United States.\n\nIn 2006 Notre Dame became the first university in Australia to gain ISO 14001 certification for its environmental management systems.\n\nIn 2008 the University of Notre Dame Australia took part in the international Interfaith Center of Beijing and in the International Symposium on the contribution of religions to sustainable development, held at Shandong University in Jinan, Shandong Province, China.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Australia has two major sites: the Craigieburn campus and the Werribee Park campus.\n\nCraigieburn campus\n\nThe Craigieburn campus, located at the northern end of the Monash Freeway, houses the Schools of Architecture, Business, Communication and Social Sciences, Education, Health, Humanities and Law, Music, Science and Sport. The campus is also home to the University's administration and a student village.\n\nWerribee Park campus\n\nThe Werribee Park campus is home to the School of Education and Social Work. The campus is also the site of the University's Sport Centre.\n\nUniversity library\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Australia Library holds over 43,000 print volumes and over 2,000 CD-ROMs. The collection covers theology, philosophy, the arts, social sciences and sciences.\n\nThe library's periodical collection contains more than 15,000 current serials including complete runs of the major theological journals. It also holds more than 2,000 current audiovisual titles, 2,000 electronic books and 3,000 electronic journal articles. The library is fully networked to connect to the Internet and to link with all parts of the University, and all staff and students have access to its facilities. The library is a member of the Council of Regional Libraries in Victoria (CRLV) and of the National Library of Australia's Research Collections Network (RCLN).\n\nThe library also houses the university's Special Collections and the Archives, including the history of the Congregation of Holy Cross in Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, the history of the Holy Cross College (now the University of Notre Dame Australia), and personal papers of members of the Congregation of Holy Cross and its educational institutions. The Archives are open to the public.\n\nResearch centres and institutes\n\nThe university has research centres and institutes including the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN), the Australian Institute of Music, the National Institute for Education Development (NIEd), the Australian Institute for Indigenous Development, and the Aloysius JinEndean Lidcombe Catholic Library.\n\nThe university also has research alliances with other universities and institutions.\n\nIn 2011, the University of Notre Dame Australia was awarded the \u201cVice-Chancellor\u2019s Award for Excellence in Corporate Reporting\u201d by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility.

Ion beam studies of materials use mass spectrometry to study materials. Ion beam analysis is the name used for the techniques developed to study the solid materials with either a gas or a particle beam. Particle beams are commonly produced by ion guns or by secondary ion mass spectrometry. For high resolution, single particle mass spectrometry (called single particle IBA) or time of flight (TOF) instruments are employed. For many studies, electron microscopes can be used with appropriate detectors.\n\nSingle particle mass spectrometry was invented by Herb Guyer and Edward A. Heineman at Cornell University in 1953. This technique was the foundation of the field of ion beam analysis. This technique has been used to study a wide range of materials including metals, ceramics, glasses, organics and polymers.\n\nIn this technique the ion beam is focused to a small spot size on the sample, either by focusing in a magnetic or an electrostatic field or by being focused by electrostatic fields in a multielectrode system. The beam is then scanned over the surface of the sample. For each sample point, a mass spectrum of the sample material is obtained. The signals from the individual elements in the sample are then compared to each other in order to determine the composition and/or structure of the sample. This is because the signals are characteristic of the elements from which they are produced. The process of matching up the signals is called deconvolution. In this technique, the detector signal is measured only when a particle of the beam is detected.\n\nThe disadvantage of this technique is that it requires much more time to measure each sample point compared to scanning probe microscopes (which use electron beams).\n\nThe electron microscope with a detector attached to it can be used as an IBA tool. It is very useful to study the microstructure of ceramics and glasses.\n\nThe technique was developed at Cornell University and its name was coined by Thomas Vale in 1959. In electron microscope IBA, the sample is placed on a thin window and a beam of electrons is directed at it. The beam of electrons is either the electron beam itself or the secondary electron beam produced by a beam of primary electrons.\n\nWhen the electron beam is directed at the sample, some of the electrons are absorbed by the sample. This produces electrons inside the material and some ions. The ions are extracted by an electric field and are accelerated. The electrons emitted from the ions are detected. The detector may be a microchannel plate (MCP) detector or an electron multiplier.\n\nIn these systems the electron beam is accelerated between two plates.

It is used to transfer power to the boiler in the event of a power failure. These switches are &quot;automatic&quot; in the sense that they monitor the power flow through the generator and as soon as the power goes off, they engage the transfer switch (in parallel to the house breaker) to power the boiler. When the power is restored, the ATC turns off and disconnects the power to the boiler, restoring the house power. (We are not responsible for damages caused by not following these instructions). Before starting to install the system, you need to find the right place to put your ATC switch. Some considerations include: 1. You should put your ATC as close to the back of the generator as possible. This will make it easier for you to wire it up. 2. It is important to find a place that is dry. You can't use an ATC outside. It will just short out if it gets wet. 3. It needs to be in an accessible place (inside your home).

How about better user experience? There are many ways you can accomplish both.\n\n1. Reduce your page\u2019s load time\n\nGoogle uses the page load time as one of the factors when determining your search engine rankings. You can use PageSpeed Insights to measure the page load time for any URL.\n\nYou should aim for a score of 90/100 and lower. It\u2019s worth pointing out that although this factor is being used as a ranking factor, a slow site will have a negative impact on user experience, which in turn will affect your brand image, search results, and conversions.\n\n2. Enable GZIP compression\n\nGZIP compression compresses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your web pages, which reduces the size of those files and the total data transferred to the user. Google uses this factor to determine page load time.\n\nPageSpeed Insights has a compression test that allows you to measure the level of compression achieved by your website.\n\nFor more information on how to enable GZIP compression, see this article.\n\n3. Enable HTTPS\n\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) allows websites to tell browsers to avoid interacting with any sites except the ones that use HTTPS. This is useful in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nAs of this writing, Google considers HTTPS as a ranking factor in its search algorithm.\n\nThe problem is that although enabling HTTPS is pretty easy (for WordPress websites), it\u2019s not so easy when you have to replace all of your URLs with HTTPS URLs, and make sure that your backlinks are using HTTPS.\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to migrate, you can use the free tool from CloudFlare, which allows you to encrypt your WordPress website and even apply SSL to all of your images, making the switch to HTTPS easy and effective.\n\n4. Check your internal links\n\nInternal links are links that point to another page on your own website. Google uses these links to determine the value of the pages in your website, and how well your site is structured.\n\nLink-building specialists will tell you that there are a lot of ways to build good quality links.\n\nFor example, you can use social bookmarking sites, forums, and blogs. For links pointing to your website, you can ask friends, relatives, clients, and business partners to post links to your website on their websites.\n\nBut, you should do this within reason, and avoid looking like a link-building spammer.\n\n5. Include internal links in your blog posts\n\nYour blog posts should include internal links, to ensure that Google can detect the relationships between your posts. This will also improve your readers\u2019 experience by allowing them to quickly find the posts that are most relevant to them.\n\n6. Create an XML sitemap\n\nAn XML sitemap is a page on your website that contains a list of all the URLs on your website. If you\u2019ve been blogging for some time, you\u2019ve probably already created a sitemap to allow search engines to crawl your site.\n\nThe problem is that search engines do not use the sitemap file on your website to crawl your website. In other words, sitemap file is useless to search engines.\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a free plugin from Yoast that can automatically generate an XML sitemap and also add the sitemap to your website.\n\n7. Install social sharing plugins\n\nSocial media is a great way to market your website and brand. Not only that, you can also use social media as a way to improve your search engine rankings.\n\nWhen you share your content on social media, you can make the content more accessible to your visitors. Not to mention the fact that social sharing plugins also provide users with a link to your content, which is great for SEO.\n\nSome of the best social sharing plugins for WordPress websites include Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter.\n\n8.

These include retail shoppers who look to Amazon for new toys or appliances, travelers who look to Expedia for airline tickets, and even patients who look to the internet to learn about a disease or find a doctor. This presents unique challenges for brand owners. While brand owners can claim ownership of certain content on their sites and apps, much of the internet is controlled by other entities. This includes social media sites, search engines, content syndicators, content aggregators, and other web sites. A brand owner who does not protect its name and trademarks on these sites risks losing control of its brand online.\n\nIn the past, brand owners who found a third-party using its trademarks or similar trademarks had to prove that the third-party was using the mark in a confusing manner. This required proving that the third-party\u2019s use of the mark was likely to cause confusion in the mind of the average consumer, i.e. that it was likely to be mistaken for the mark of the brand owner. Today, however, that burden of proof is no longer necessary.\n\nA little over one year ago, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided the landmark case of Global-Tech v. eBay, 562 F.3d 982 (9th Cir. 2009). The Global-Tech decision held that a plaintiff can bring a claim against a third-party for cybersquatting by using the new procedures set forth in the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 (\u201cACPA\u201d). Previously, under the ACPA, a brand owner had to prove confusion to make a cybersquatting claim. Under the new regime, the burden has been placed on the third-party to show that its use of a domain name is legitimate.\n\nThe burden shift was the most significant change in the Global-Tech case. Before Global-Tech, a cybersquatting plaintiff had to prove confusion. After Global-Tech, a cybersquatting plaintiff only needs to prove that a defendant has registered a domain name similar to the plaintiff\u2019s mark with bad faith intent to profit.\n\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, \u201cthe ACPA\u2019s [bad faith] requirement means little more than that a domain name registrant must intend to profit from the goodwill associated with the plaintiff\u2019s mark.\u201d\n\nOnce a cybersquatting plaintiff has proven this intent, a plaintiff need only show that it owns a trademark that is similar to the defendant\u2019s domain name in order to prevail on its claim. This is the essence of the burden shift. A plaintiff who successfully proves that the defendant is cybersquatting on a domain name that is similar to its trademark does not need to prove that consumers are being confused. The cybersquatter must show that its use of the domain name is legitimate.\n\nThe Global-Tech case also made it easier for a plaintiff to win a cybersquatting case because of the additional burdens placed on a defendant.\n\nFirst, the Global-Tech case made it harder for a cybersquatting defendant to defend itself on the merits. Before Global-Tech, a defendant could defend a cybersquatting claim by arguing that its use of the domain name was not confusing to consumers. However, after Global-Tech, a defendant can no longer rely on its good faith use of the domain name to show that it is not cybersquatting. Instead, a defendant must show that its use of the mark is legitimate. This has led to claims of cybersquatting where the mark and the domain name are similar, but where there is no evidence that consumers are being confused.\n\nSecond, the Global-Tech case made it easier for a cybersquatting plaintiff to obtain injunctive relief. Traditionally, a cybersquatting plaintiff had to show that it was likely to prevail on its claim in order to obtain an injunction to prevent a defendant from using its domain name. After Global-Tech, a plaintiff need only show that the defendant is likely to profit from its use of the domain name to obtain an injunction. Since an injunction may be obtained before trial, this allows plaintiffs to eliminate the use of their marks by defendants before they can defend their actions in court.\n\nThe Global-Tech case has led to a shift in the burden of proof in cybersquatting cases. This shift has created an environment where cybersquatting cases are becoming more difficult to defend.]" time="0.537"><properties><property name="score" value="0.24693155" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.24693155&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.24693155

The first week of this month is no different, as there's just a couple of new games on the way to the system's digital store.\n\nComing to North America this week is the sequel to the surprise hit of 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. The platformer has a rich history on the PC and consoles, but this remake proved to be well worth the time spent by the fans. With a new look and modern gameplay, this is certainly worth your time if you haven't played it yet. The Dragon's Trap releases in North America on February 9.\n\nFor our European readers, this week brings us into the dangerous world of SteamWorld Dig 2. While the first game was critically acclaimed and earned quite a bit of love, this sequel looks to improve on the formula by adding a lot more variety and some online multiplayer options. Dig 2 is a bit more than a week away, and will be available on February 9.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, then you'll be happy to know that the Nintendo Switch's Virtual Console service has something new in store for you. For the week of February 13, the Nintendo 64 classic Donkey Kong 64 will be available on the system's store.\n\nAs always, we'll keep an eye on the eShop and update you on new releases if and when they become available.

The device I am testing has a button which, when pressed, will alter the value of something between 1% and 100%. How can I find out what that value is? I know that it's 1% - 100%, but I want to know the value of the device and how it affects the outcome.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nMike\n\nIan Smith You need to identify what it is you are actually measuring.\n\n\n\nAre you measuring the current through a certain circuit? If so, you need to measure the voltage drop across it (and also the current through the circuit itself)\n\nAre you measuring the temperature of a thermocouple?\n\nAre you measuring the force produced by a tensile tester?\n\netc etc.\n\n\n\nThe only way to find out is to identify what is actually changing (when the button is pressed) and what is being measured.\n\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMikeJackness You need to identify what it is you are actually measuring.\n\n\n\nAre you measuring the current through a certain circuit?

I'm looking at the values in the actual device rather than the sensor values.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nI guess I'll have to figure out what the resistance is when the motor is not turning and what it is when it is, then identify the variables that affect it.\n\n\n\nAny more ideas would be great.\n\nIan Smith I'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nAh! Well, you've gone and identified the system (stepper motor) and the variables (resistance). Now all you have to do is find out the actual resistance and how it changes when the motor is turned.\n\n\n\nAlso, have you determined whether the motor is powered from an AC mains supply or from a DC battery (or similar)? You need to know this because AC mains supplies may vary the current they provide, depending on the load (which may include the motor), and some DC supplies may have a current limit (which you may need to bypass if it's too low).\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMikeJackness Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\nIan Smith Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\n\n\n1. Both, to begin with. You may only need one, but you may need two, and it's better to have two of them.\n\n\n\n2. As above. If you can't build the current measurement, then either use one of the basic models that has a current setting, or use the voltage reading on the meter and then calculate the current from that. (e.g. multiply by 0.6 to get approximate amperes)\n\n\n\n3. Again, as above. If you can't build a current measurement, then you can get a panel meter to do the job for you, or you can try one of the fancier meters that have current measurement as one of their functions.\n\nMikeJackness Thanks for the replies. I am currently using two multimeters, a panel meter and a handheld meter.\n\n\n\nI've built an adjustable resistance using one of the 5W, 12V heater elements from a microwave. When I put it in series with the motor it showed a resistance of around 400 Ohms.\n\n\n\nI was then trying to identify how much current it drew when it was switched on, and I couldn't get a good result because the panel meter wasn't reading it properly.\n\n\n\nI think that's where I'm at with it at the moment.

Hyland has developed his own approach, based on a number of leading methods, to show the student how to apply them to language use. Divided into four parts, this book explores the key concepts, applications and findings of these methods, in the first section looking at language and discourse as a unit, in the second examining patterns of text structure, in the third explaining how discourse is used to construct particular kinds of meaning, and in the fourth looking at how we study discourse. The first three sections introduce three different approaches to discourse analysis - the macro-structural approaches of Saussure and Gee, the micro-structural approach of Halliday, and the interpersonal approaches of Brown and Hodge. The last section explores ways in which different kinds of discourse are studied, including conversation, literature, power, work and the media. What I liked: This is an excellent textbook. It provides a good survey of a range of discourses analysis approaches and provides clear descriptions of the methodological principles of these approaches. This is an approachable introduction to a complex and diverse field. The topics covered include the analysis of conversation, text and the various modes of literature. Hyland shows how the same principles can be applied to these different types of text. He draws on a wide range of literature to show how discourses can be studied and includes many examples of actual texts. The book is very clearly written, contains many well-chosen examples, and provides a good introduction to a subject which is likely to be of increasing interest to Linguists. What I didn't like: The chapter on the analysis of conversation and the chapter on the analysis of discourse in fictional texts would benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the key concepts used in this type of analysis. For example, the chapter on conversation provides an excellent introduction to this type of discourse, but it would be better if there was a clearer discussion of the concepts of turn-taking and overlap, and a more careful explanation of the use of 'look-back' studies and the main types of transcription. The chapter on discourse in fictional texts provides an introduction to a type of analysis which has not been covered elsewhere in the book, and this is an important addition to the text. However, this chapter does not include the discussion of the key concepts of discourse analysis which is provided in the other chapters. It would have been better if this chapter could have followed the same format as the other chapters, and discussed how a particular approach was developed, what its key concepts are, and how these concepts can be applied. I think that this is an important addition to the book. Another minor point is that there are several typos in the book, but I don't think that this detracts from the overall quality of the book. What is missing: A discussion of the key concepts of discourse analysis which can be applied to all types of text.]" time="0.478"><properties><property name="score" value="0.007755152" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[More than 600 students in the CSU system are waiting for their transcripts to be cleared.\n\nTranscripts at CSU campuses are frozen for over 600 students who attended the Pueblo campus last semester, and if they don't complete their credits and final exams, they could lose their scholarships and their seats.\n\nAccording to the CSU-Pueblo website, 615 students have not yet completed their spring semester.

When Lexus first introduced the current ES in 2006, the formula was right. But by 2012, it had become dated. The original ES was slow, thirsty and not very capable. The second generation added power and speed and was the first ES to tow. With the third generation, Lexus has taken that formula one step further and brought in all-wheel drive and a more refined driving experience. But it also kept the old formula.\n\nStyling\n\nThe 2014 Lexus ES shares its looks with the outgoing model and in a way with the new IS sedans as well. So it is a blend of a wedge shape and something more traditional. From some angles, it is vaguely reminiscent of the LFA. Its grille is pronounced, its side character lines are muscular and its curves on the hood and trunk are attractive and not overdone.\n\nIts front end is more Lexus-like than before and its tail is more sedan-like than before. It has a more modern look without being overly aggressive and its design is not overly bland like some of its competitors.

Wrong!\n\nI was an old punk. I ate cheaply. I ate unhealthily. I went out for food once a week, never paid more than $8 for a plate of rice and 2 pieces of chicken. Other times I ate popcorn and French Fries with my friends while watching movies in the cinema. And as I became an adult, I ate badly and grew fat.\n\nLast year, I decided to change my life. I started to save money, and from that day, I stopped eating cheaply.\n\nHere are some tips I picked up.\n\n1. Choose the cheaper meal of the day\n\nMcDonalds have only 2 types of meals that are cheaper than the rest. These are the McD Snack Meal and McD Value Meals.\n\nThe McD Snack Meal cost RM5.69, which includes a Chicken McSpicy or Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink. The McD Value Meal costs RM8.19, which includes a Big Mac, a McSpicy or a Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink.\n\nBoth meals are cheaper than the other meals that you can buy.\n\nThe cheapest meal of the day in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal.\n\n2. Eat at \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant instead\n\nIn Singapore, McDonalds is known as \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant. And you don\u2019t need to ask \u2018Where is the nearest McDonalds?\u2019, because in Singapore, \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant and McDonalds is the same thing.\n\nIt\u2019s a myth that \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant is more expensive than McDonalds. In fact, most of the meals that are available in McDonalds can be found at \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nThe most expensive meal in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant is the Set Dinner (Veg/Chicken). The meal costs $7.20. The most expensive meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\nAll other meals in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant are cheaper than the other meals in McDonalds.\n\nFor example, the cheapest meal in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant is the Curry Puff. The Curry Puff costs $3.10. The cheapest meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\n3. Eat from 7-Eleven instead\n\nThere are two reasons why I suggest you eat at 7-Eleven instead of McDonalds or \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nThe first reason is, the food at 7-Eleven is almost as good as the food in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nThe second reason is, 7-Eleven sell drinks and fast food cheaper than McDonalds and \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nFor example, I ordered a portion of Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven. I ordered the Mac and Cheese as a take away, because I do not have any microwave in my office.\n\nThe cost of the Mac and Cheese is $3.30. And I bought a Pineapple Juice, which costs $1.30.\n\nThe total cost of my meal is $4.60. The same meal costs $4.79 in McDonalds.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven tastes a bit different from the one that I bought in McDonalds.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that the taste is not as good as the one that I can buy in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nBut it\u2019s true that the cost is almost the same.\n\n4. Avoid eating at the food court\n\nFood courts are expensive. The price of food sold at the food courts are almost the same as the cost of the same meal in a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo I\u2019ll suggest you avoid eating at the food court.\n\n5. Make food at home\n\nI make sure I cook once a day. I try my best to cook healthy meals. And the cost of the food that I make at home is much cheaper than the cost of a fast food meal.\n\n6. Eat with other people\n\nThe total cost of my meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal.\n\nFor example, I shared a Big Mac meal with my friend. The total cost of the meal was $8.20. That\u2019s because the meal cost $4.29 each.\n\nThe cost of the meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal. The cheaper meal is when I eat alone.\n\n7. Share the meal\n\nSometimes I share the meal with my partner. I usually share a meal with my partner once a week. I share the meal because I feel bad that my partner is eating alone while I\u2019m eating with my friends.\n\nIf I share the meal with my partner, the total cost is $4.60.\n\nIf I eat alone, the total cost is $4.79.\n\n8. Always look for a promotion\n\nIn McDonalds, \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant and 7-Eleven, there are always promotions.\n\nFor example, 7-Eleven and \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant sometimes offer discount on their drinks and fast food.\n\nSo I suggest you always look for a promotion before buying a meal.]" time="0.369"><properties><property name="score" value="0.00196249925" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[HapWanderlust September 1, 2011, 8:10 pm it's a very interesting product...\n\nAnonymous September 3, 2011, 12:30 am Thanks for the review, very interesting product and its feature seems to be very promising.

We are not only alive, but many of us have access to a wealth of luxury, both intellectual and material, that few of our ancestors would have dreamed of. And we also have access to media that have transformed the world. One of my sons recently discovered the fascinating series \u201cHow the Universe Works\u201d (available on Netflix). This is a television show, with a high-tech production budget, and it is fascinating. It has some of the best images of the stars and planets ever produced, with an engaging story to go with them. The soundtrack alone is amazing. I highly recommend it. But it only works because of our technology, which has the power to tell stories across the globe.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to leave the planet for science to reach you. It\u2019s right there in your living room.\n\nToday I read a story in the paper about a study that examined the safety of exercise and high protein diets. This study was designed to answer a question that most of us have faced at some point: should I cut back on protein? My story pointed out that the study was very small and inconclusive, but the real story is about how we learn about our world and why this study is inconclusive. It is a story that has been repeated again and again. When new information comes out, we all read it with the same kind of judgment that you would apply to a restaurant: is this place worth my time and money? The more of it you eat, the more of it you want to read. When I read the story in the paper, I didn\u2019t try to understand the process by which the authors made their conclusions. Instead, I simply had a gut reaction: was the story worth the cost of the information it contained?\n\nThat is the only real question that matters when we choose what to read. This question is especially important today because there is so much information out there. When the costs of information are low, it becomes much easier to consume, and with this abundance comes the difficulty of choosing what to read. So we focus on our gut. And this is because we have a brain designed to make these kinds of choices, one that is driven by emotional needs, not rational ones. We are not designed to rationally evaluate the content of each article, but instead we are designed to make emotional decisions about what to consume.\n\nThis point was well illustrated by some research done by scientists at the University of Michigan. They had two groups of subjects: one that was told to read a story that was fun and amusing, and one that was told to read a story that was sad. Then they had them make some choices about the food they would eat for the next week. The group that had been reading the sad story ate 25% fewer calories than the group that had been reading the amusing story. Why? Well, they thought that food was a reward, and since they had been unhappy in the experiment, they cut back on the number of rewards that they would give themselves. This is a very rational process, but the very fact that they were not looking at the process that led them to their choice means that it had to be some form of emotional response.\n\nIn this way, we respond to information much like we respond to food. Food provides us with energy and pleasure, so it is important to choose it well. So we think in terms of gut decisions, not because they are the best ones, but because they help us to cope with our lives. Information is also a source of energy and pleasure, and so we choose it as well.\n\nBut while we are creatures that make emotional choices about our food and information, we also have other needs. These are needs that were emphasized by the process of evolution: needs to know about the world and needs to know about ourselves. So when we read articles, or watch television, or go on social media, we need to know whether they provide this type of knowledge as well.\n\nMost of the time we are looking for a story that is interesting, and that will hold our attention. But we also want a story that tells us something about our world. The better the story is, the more likely we are to learn from it. A story about calories and exercise might not be particularly interesting, but it is important for us to know. A story about the stars and planets might be fascinating, but it doesn\u2019t matter if it is a good story or not.\n\nThis is because we need information about our world to survive and to thrive, and we know this to be true because it is encoded in our DNA. Our brains have evolved to help us process the information that we receive, and so it makes sense that we]" time="0.384"><properties><property name="score" value="0.12178427" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[By \u201cspecial\u201d, I mean, \u201ca man who plays a very particular role\u201d. This man is a type of \u201cperformer\u201d, a type that is often put forward in business culture and in the literature of business leadership, and many men admire it and want to be seen as this type of man. It is the man who is never at a loss for words, and always knows exactly what to say, and is a good listener too. He has an instinctive understanding of people\u2019s moods and emotions. He is the man with the plan. He knows what\u2019s going on. He has a direct influence on others. He is never without a list of bullet-points, even if he\u2019s just going into the shop. He\u2019s good at handling pressure and he\u2019s a team player. He is the man who is looked to for a reaction.\n\nYou can call this type of man many different things. I am going to call him a \u201cbusiness executive\u201d, as it is most widely-used, but it is also a term that is rather different from the role of \u201cbusiness leader\u201d, and which I will also address. I am a business executive, and I have been a business executive for as long as I can remember, and I\u2019m a fairly typical example of a business executive. I think that most people reading this will find that it accurately describes at least a few men that they know.\n\nMost men aspire to this particular role. Some men even feel a burning need to play it. They will not be happy or feel satisfied in life unless they are in this particular role. They often judge themselves by it. They have a high level of need and drive to be a business executive.\n\nBeing a business executive is one of the \u201cgood\u201d ways to be a man, it is one of the ways in which men \u201cmake a difference\u201d and \u201chave an impact\u201d. It is also one of the ways in which men achieve \u201crespect\u201d, \u201crespect\u201d being an essential element in most men\u2019s internal lives. Many men do feel that it is through this role that they will achieve respect, in the same way that they might feel that they achieve respect in the rest of their life. They might not be consciously aware of this, and they may have a lot of other reasons for doing what they do, but respect is there, and is an important part of their motivation.\n\nThis type of role is one of the ways in which men achieve success and status. It is also one of the ways in which they can \u201cgain influence\u201d and \u201cchange things\u201d. It is the way that they \u201chelp people\u201d and \u201cchange things\u201d and \u201cmake a difference\u201d. It is the way that men can \u201chave a great career\u201d, and achieve \u201csuccess\u201d, and \u201cbe respected\u201d, and \u201cmake money\u201d.\n\nIt is not necessary to believe that these are the only or even the most important reasons for having a job. In my experience, most people, male and female, care about these things to some degree or other. I am not attempting to persuade anyone that these are \u201cunimportant\u201d things, I am not setting out to denigrate them. But it is important to understand that these are reasons for working. People, both male and female, need these things, and it is to these needs that they often respond when asked why they work.\n\nBusiness executives often find it easy to get good work. Many people are happy to trust their judgement, because they are good at understanding the people around them, and they can provide answers to difficult questions. They often find it easy to get good work, and they may have a number of people to choose from when looking for a new job.\n\nThey often feel that they are \u201cjustified\u201d and \u201chave a right\u201d to be in the position that they are in. They have earned it.\n\nThis type of role is very similar to that of \u201cbusiness leader\u201d, but these are very different roles. Many people confuse them, and use them as synonyms, and they are often referred to as such in business literature and the popular media. They are not synonyms. They are two different roles, and their differences can be seen in the relationship of the people around them.\n\nThe business executive is a man who is often very popular and well-liked. He is a man who is often admired. He is often seen as the man to turn to for answers. People come to him to find out what is going on, and to find out what to do. He often knows what to say, and he has an instinctive understanding of people\u2019s moods and emotions, and a quick and accurate understanding of the situations that he is faced with. He is a man who is often used by other people as a sounding-board, as a person to talk things over with, as a man to provide feedback and reaction.\n\nBut this is often not the case with the business leader. He often gets into trouble with the people around him, and he often gets an awkward response to his advice. He is not often looked to for feedback or reactions. He often does not feel that he has the understanding that he wants, and that he needs, and that he feels he deserves. He often feels that he is not looked to as much as he would like, and that people would turn to someone else if he were not there.\n\nThis type of role is the most important in a business organisation. It is not a role that most men can aspire to. In fact, I would say that most men do not aspire to it. And for many, if not most, men it is not a role that they can play well.\n\nFor many men, playing this role will lead them into unhappiness. They will feel frustrated and unhappy, and it is often a role that causes men to turn against the organisation that they are working for.\n\nMany men who try to be business executives will often find themselves in a difficult situation. Many men will find that they are working for organisations that do not have a business executive position. They will find that they are attempting to play a role that does not exist in the organisation that they are working for.\n\nMany men are unhappy when they try to be business executives. Many of them will be unhappy if they do not play that role.\n\nThere are, of course, many other types of men, and many other types of roles that they play. But this particular type of man and role is a very special one.\n\nA case study of a \u201cbusiness executive\u201d\n\nThis is a man who is very good at his job, a very clever and able man, a man who has an instinctive understanding of people\u2019s moods and emotions, and who has a natural ability to speak effectively and confidently to other people. He has a good understanding of other people, and he has an ability to work with other people. He understands other people\u2019s motivations and he understands what is important to them. He has a good understanding of what people will do, what they will say, and what they will not say, and he understands what is going to happen and how things will turn out. He understands people\u2019s moods and emotions. He is quick to understand how things are going to turn out, and he is quick to make decisions.\n\nThis man is a good communicator. He is the type of man who people turn to for reactions. He is the man who knows what to say, and who knows how to say it. He is good at dealing with difficult people, and he can handle difficult situations. He is good at explaining things to other people. He is good at handling pressure, he is good at dealing with crises, and he is good at giving people confidence.\n\nThis man has a good understanding of his organisation, and he has a good understanding of his work. He is often the man that people go to when they need information. He is the man who has a good overview of the situation.\n\nThis man has a good understanding of his organisation\u2019s finances. He has a good understanding of his organisation\u2019s future, and he can see things that other people cannot see. He is the man who knows what is going to happen. He is a man who has the answers, and a man who knows what to do. He has the information that other people need. He has an instinctive understanding of his organisation\u2019s situation.

For the status effect, see Poison\n\nFor the Hunter creature, see King black dragon\n\nVenom is a poisonous status effect inflicted by many creatures, and is inflicted by the dragon dagger special move. It deals low damage over time, reducing the player's defence level, and decreasing the effectiveness of protection prayers and similar effects. There is no venom available as a spell in RuneScape.\n\nWhen venom is applied, a timer of 16 seconds begins and the afflicted player receives the message &quot;You are beginning to feel venomous!&quot; This timer can be frozen using either an antipoison, or an antifire potion if the dragon dagger special attack is used against the player.\n\nContents show]\n\nSigns and symptoms Edit\n\nIf you get hit by poison, you may notice the following symptoms:\n\nInability to eat while venom is active (unless the player is using food that heals life points only)\n\nInability to cure poison with antipoison or heal poison using poison cures whilst the venom is active (unless the player is using antipoisons or super antipoisons)\n\nA decrease in defence level\n\nVenom damage Edit\n\nPoison has a poison damage value of 10 + 4 * n {\\displaystyle 10+4*n} , where n {\\displaystyle n} is the number of hits received. This means that the average damage of a venom hit is 22.5% higher than the hit's base damage. The maximum poison damage is 120 + 10 * n {\\displaystyle 120+10*n} , which occurs when the player is hit 16 times by venom.\n\nAs with other damage over time effects, poison damage is not affected by damage modifiers or protection prayers.\n\nResistance Edit\n\nThe player's resistance to venom is related to the player's Defence level, and reduces the damage done by venom accordingly. A player with level 90 Defence or higher will be almost immune to the venom of most dragons, while those with a lower Defence level will take considerable damage from even low-level dragons. The dragon dagger's special attack provides temporary immunity to poison from venom, however this immunity is lost when the dagger's special attack is used up, or if the player unequips the dagger.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nEven though the Venom poison effect was not in RuneScape Classic, a poisoned player would say the same thing: &quot;I feel a little woozy...&quot;]" time="0.277"><properties><property name="score" value="1.3813539" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Description\n\nOn 2 June 1945 in the Tiergarten of Berlin, hours after Hitler had committed suicide, Major-General Hans Krebs (with his right hand raised) signed the German instrument of surrender.

And they have failed to produce it for one simple reason: it will have to meet with the ACCC guidelines in relation to Telstra. I was very happy to provide those guidelines to the opposition. I can provide them again this morning if they want.\n\n\n\nSenator Campbell \u2014We know you are the legal supremo.\n\n\n\nThe PRESIDENT \u2014Senator Krueger, on your own account, to get a bit of latitude\u2014I think you have five minutes now.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER \u2014Thank you, Mr President. What I can do is provide them again this morning, but if the opposition has the same rhetoric it has used at the last election\u2014and I know it is used at every election by the leader of the opposition\u2014then it will fail to have its proposal examined in any great detail by the ACCC. It is not because we have an axe to grind, it is because the opposition have an axe to grind. But it does not pass the ACCC test, and it is interesting that they do not want to have that detailed examination of their proposal.\n\nLet us have a look at what Telstra said yesterday. The headline, of course, in the Australian Financial Review is \u2018Telstra asks regulator to speed up broadband overhaul\u2019. You would be very happy about that, Senator, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\n\n\nSenator Campbell \u2014We are.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER \u2014The point is that you have not said what the rates are. But if you had done your job in the last election and had produced your plan, then the ACCC would have had the option to have you examine your plan and to determine what the rates should be and whether they could be extended. What we have done is ensure that the interest of consumers and business in this country are protected. We have done it by putting in a position where the ACCC will have the opportunity to examine any privatisation proposal that the opposition has.\n\nAnd, Mr President, there are a number of aspects of Telstra that have been raised by the opposition.

Bats have amazing social connections and perform complex rituals that ensure the welfare of their group members. They are amazing hunters of both insects and fruit, thanks to their very good eyesight and a large brain for processing data. Because of their social abilities and prey-catching skills, the bat has been hunted and killed.\n\nAccording to the Bats of Trinidad and Tobago website, \u201cSince bats are prey for many animals, the loss of bat populations due to predation is widespread. Predatory birds and snakes, for example, may take a large number of bats from a colony.\u201d\n\nI often wish for such care, consideration and connection when I\u2019m interacting with other people. I often wonder what it would be like to have relationships built on respect, reciprocity and trust. My hope is that someday all the people in the world will connect with their hearts and brains, and practice empathetic responses to others.\n\nThough a long time ago, I have even heard the birds and bats say\u2026\n\nCome on baby, light my fire.\n\nI wanna be burned, and baby, then you\u2019ll desire.\n\nTo my readers, I\u2019d like to introduce a new piece of music that I recorded on a ukulele.

He described them as &quot;friends&quot; who had &quot;brought calm&quot; to the region.\n\n&quot;This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil,&quot; Trump said, according to a White House pool report. &quot;If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing, then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil.&quot;\n\nIt's an evolution for Trump, who had attacked the trio of Middle East leaders during the campaign and, after he won, avoided being too complimentary about them.\n\nAnd in the days before his speech, Trump had been on the attack again against Qatar. He had bashed the Gulf country in a series of tweets for alleged &quot;funding of terrorism,&quot; which triggered the diplomatic rift. Trump went to Saudi Arabia on his first trip abroad as President.\n\nTrump has backed the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar and threatened &quot;severe punishment&quot; against Doha for its alleged &quot;sponsorship of terrorism,&quot; according to a Qatari official who spoke with CNN.\n\nTrump's comments about Salman and Faisal came just after he spoke about the Iran nuclear deal. Trump said it was an &quot;embarrassment to the United States&quot; and called it &quot;one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.&quot;\n\nIt is also not the first time Trump has praised King Salman. After his inauguration, Trump made a phone call to the king. He called him a &quot;very wise person who wants to see things get much better rapidly&quot; and called their relationship &quot;extremely good.&quot;\n\nKing Salman was the first world leader to speak to Trump after he was inaugurated, and Salman joined Trump in a visit to a home in Riyadh that was built for families of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US.\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Faisal was assassinated in 1975.\n\nBut despite that history, Trump has only been complimentary about the Saudis, but not in the way some have accused him of being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Saudis helped him create the first page in his Middle East policy.\n\nHe praised the Saudis after he won the election, saying, &quot;Saudi Arabia and I get along great.&quot; He had spoken about it as a campaign issue, saying in March 2016 that he &quot;would like to protect Saudi Arabia&quot; but that the country is &quot;going to have to help us economically&quot; in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTrump had also said in December 2015 that he was against the &quot;concept of bombing&quot; and was for a strong intelligence-gathering effort instead.

On Saturday, Danny Garcia and Robert Guerrero will be fighting in the co-main event of the Alvarez-Kovalev undercard, and they are both in the top five of my pound-for-pound list. The winner of this fight will be the mandatory challenger to Keith Thurman for the WBC welterweight title.\n\nThis fight is just one example of how competitive boxing has been in recent years. There are so many great fighters that we could have one of the best years in boxing in recent memory. But before we go any further, let\u2019s take a look at the four fights that were announced this past week.\n\nFor Alvarez-Kovalev, it was the best fight that could have been made at this time in boxing. In the beginning of 2015, the year started off great with Miguel Cotto vs. Canelo Alvarez, which was supposed to be one of the best fights of the year. But instead, it was a non-event and was a flop. Both fighters looked bad, and the fans were disappointed. That being said, the promoters realized that Cotto vs. Alvarez II would not do great numbers, so a rematch was out of the question.\n\nWith Cotto leaving Top Rank, there was a gaping hole in the middleweight division. Alvarez wanted to stay at 154 pounds, but the only option for him was to go up to 160 to fight the middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin. But with Golovkin only having one fight in 2016, and the third bout against Martin Murray in March, the timing could not have been any better for this fight.\n\nWhile the fight is taking place in Las Vegas, it should not hurt the Mexican fighter. The best fights involving Mexican fighters in Las Vegas have always been ones where the opponent is big in name and popularity. Alvarez has already faced Floyd Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Alfredo Angulo, James Kirkland and Miguel Cotto. He has had two pay-per-view fights in Las Vegas, and he has never been hurt by the size of the city or venue.\n\nAlvarez is favored to win this fight, but that could all change if he loses to Golovkin. For those that don\u2019t know, boxing fans can be ruthless, and one loss can change everything. But in the end, the fans and the boxing industry will be the biggest winners in this fight.\n\nThen we move on to Lomachenko vs. Walters. These two fighters have two of the most awkward and beautiful styles in boxing. With Lomachenko being at 122, and Walters being at 130, this is a fight that could not be missed. Walters will be giving up eight pounds to the Ukrainian, but that is not a huge factor in this fight. Lomachenko is only about 1.5 inches shorter than Walters, and he is naturally taller.\n\nThe big difference between these two fighters is the lack of power by Walters. He has knocked out 34 out of his 35 opponents, but his most recent fight was against IBF super featherweight champion Miguel Berchelt. Walters could not KO Berchelt, and he lost a 12-round decision. Walters does not have a huge knockout percentage, and Lomachenko does not get knocked out. So it will be interesting to see how this fight plays out.\n\nThe fight that I am looking forward to the most is Garcia vs. Guerrero. These two fighters are very competitive in their division, and they are both in their prime. Garcia has already had two losses this year, but they were to Shawn Porter and Keith Thurman. Those two fights were competitive and competitive in style. But Garcia showed heart and talent in both of those fights.\n\nGuerrero is coming off of a very exciting win over Andre Berto in November. He was hurt several times in the fight, but he pulled out a split decision. Garcia is coming off of a draw with Porter in March, and he is currently ranked No. 3 by the WBC. While Guerrero is ranked No. 4, he has the ability to beat Garcia. Both fighters are fairly similar in style, and if Garcia is smart, he will win this fight.\n\nThe last fight is a big one: Nicholas Walters vs. Vasyl Lomachenko. I am hoping that this fight does not happen until 2018. The reason is because Lomachenko has a fight with Guillermo Rigondeaux on Dec. 9, and Walters is fighting in March. I want to see both fighters in top condition in this fight. With a possible date of April 28, 2018, it will give the fighters plenty of time to prepare.\n\nI believe that this fight could possibly happen before the end of the year. With Walters fighting on March 4 against Jason Sosa, and Lomachenko fighting on Dec. 9, it could set up this fight for the end of the year. Both fighters are on HBO, and the boxing industry will be happy if this fight takes place. Walters has already fought Lomachenko once in 2013, and Lomachenko is undefeated since that fight.\n\nThe only fight that I am looking forward to more than this one is GGG vs. Alvarez. But this is the second most anticipated fight of the year for me. Walters has proven that he can fight great fighters, but he has not faced anyone that could compare to Lomachenko. Walters was supposed to fight Miguel Marriaga on Nov. 26, but it was cancelled due to his weight.\n\nFor Lomachenko, he has had two tough fights against Guillermo Rigondeaux and Jason Sosa, and they have both been challenging fights for him. Lomachenko has fought great fighters such as Nicholas Walters, Gary Russell Jr., and Orlando Salido]" time="0.728"><properties><property name="score" value="0.018975941000000003" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Self Portrait was a virtual representation of one of Ratonhnhak\xe9:ton's genetic memories, relived by Desmond Miles in 2012 through the Animus.\n\nContents show]\n\nDescription Edit\n\nRatonhnhak\xe9:ton was getting dressed when he heard the sound of barking.

I didn't know what to expect, but it blew me away. As I was preparing to sit down with Richard Linklater to discuss his new film, I had that same feeling. How do you get an audience to empathize with characters they would normally write off as deplorable, if not outright despicable? We talked about this and more, along with the film's complex themes, which Linklater and his actors spent years developing. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nHugh: So what I'm really curious about, it's a little bit about tone. The last scene is going to be one of the most talked about, but there are lots of moments in the film where I don't think it's going to be easy to laugh. We're going to laugh, but it's going to be a complicated laugh. I want to know how you feel about that scene, and the importance of it being there, and what else is going to be the most talked about scene for people?\n\nRichard: You know what, I don't have a clue. I had a couple of moments. You know, I don't think it's anything like the rape scene. You know, that was one that everybody seemed to feel like the first time they saw it, at least in the audience screenings, there was a palpable kind of, &quot;Oh my god.&quot; But the bowling alley thing, we went through a couple of different iterations of it, and I thought the kids were just going to keep on throwing stuff at him, and he'd get up and leave, but no, that was the one that made people in the audience just go, &quot;I can't.&quot; I mean, I remember, I just think of, I have to confess that I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I remember some of the testing, because the movie tested a lot. And they always give you these cards, like &quot;what scene did you love, what scene did you hate,&quot; or whatever, and I was shocked by some of the things that people found totally inconsequential. You know, the whole detention room scene was almost universally praised. They loved that, they thought that was great, and the end of it, not so much.\n\nHugh: Yeah. The thing that's different about this film, obviously, is it's not only looking at people and their humanness. It's also looking at their flaws. I mean, you could write these guys off as total scumbags, but it's also very clear that they're young, and they're just trying to find their way. And that's what makes this so powerful.\n\nRichard: That was very intentional, and the fact that I had kids in the film, that was a choice that I made very consciously, because I wanted to get the perspective of the younger people who are looking at the world for the first time. And, you know, they don't have the same values that we do. They're different, and they don't realize it, but they are. They haven't been tested yet. And they're also kind of looking at, you know, maybe the judgmental generation that they have to become. So it was very conscious.\n\nHugh: So you're interested in their stories. What about the parents? I mean, you're going to be a parent soon, how has that changed the way you look at this film and the stories?\n\nRichard: I think it's made me even more interested in getting the stories right of the younger people, and being as honest as I can with them. I mean, I've thought about, I want to do a prequel, you know, like set in the '70s. I've thought about doing one that goes into the '90s, and then just getting closer and closer and closer to what it's like today, but really starting in the '70s and the '80s.\n\nHugh: It's a very complicated thing, and I know you've talked about this a lot, I mean, this idea of nostalgia. But I feel like there's a particular version of nostalgia that goes with this film. You know, you look at the sort of deep Americana in the film. I mean, how do you feel about that?\n\nRichard: Well, I guess I don't really know what you mean by that.\n\nHugh: It's this kind of very rich Americana that really looks at what life was like before people moved to the suburbs.\n\nRichard: Well, that was intentional, that was sort of the style of the film, but there were a lot of choices in the film, you know, that were very deliberate, and one was to make it as realistic as possible. You know, there was no comedy, there was no satire. I mean, it was really the intention, and one of the ideas that we were talking about was, how can you really make people identify with these people, if they're like, I mean, just people would say, &quot;Oh, they're just total scumbags,&quot; and that's not the intention. You know, it's like, how can you make people feel like this is a reality, and it's not a joke? And I guess that was one of the choices, you know, like that was just something that was a choice that we were very intentional about.\n\nHugh: What about you? How much do you want this film to be like the experience you remember, and how much do you want to add your own personal story into it?\n\nRichard: You know, I guess, I can remember the moment, it's hard to put into words, but it was, it was a really, it was a weird thing, I was in high school, and we were supposed to be staying at this place, and I was going to walk there. And I was, it was very late, it was like, after 10:00 at night, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I was like, you know, what the hell, you know? And I started walking, and I started walking, and I ended up in my bed, but I just had this sense of loneliness and alienation that I can't describe, but it was a very, it's kind of hard to put into words.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: So I think that's one of the things that was in the film, that's in all my films, but I think that was something that maybe people don't talk about. But it's, you know, the great teenage angst, that's like a rite of passage, you know, and I guess that was one of the ideas. I think that's what you mean by kind of a different nostalgia.\n\nHugh: Yeah, but I also wonder if it's almost more... It's like an explanation of the parents, of why they are who they are. You know, because I feel like, I mean, you're an independent filmmaker. You're not making a studio movie, but a lot of these people are making that decision because it's a career, but it's also that they're really starting to question their parents.\n\nRichard: That's a good point. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's probably true. But I'm not sure that the same characters would make the same choices. You know, it's a little bit different.\n\nHugh: That's true.\n\nRichard: So I mean, I guess there's probably a different way of looking at it, but I'm not sure.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: But that's probably true.\n\nHugh: One of the other things that I think is so powerful about the movie, is you can't really tell that they're all the same age.\n\nRichard: Right.\n\nHugh: You know, I think a lot of the time, especially in independent movies, you really can't, especially with characters who are supposed to be that age. But you really do a great job of putting that in there.\n\nRichard: You know, that was a real choice. The only choice that we did was when the girls are taking their bikini tops off, we did make them a little bit older than the guys, because the guys, they were mostly 18, and the girls, you know, they were 21, and they wanted to look that way, you know.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: I didn't want to deal with, you know, the issue of kids playing these kinds of roles, you know.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: So, you know, that was one of the choices that we made, but other than that, you know, that was a choice that we made.\n\nHugh: You know, I can't help but think of the movies that inspired this. You know, I'm wondering if there are any that you feel like really influenced you, or you thought about as you were working on this.\n\nRichard: There were lots of movies, but I can't think of any specifically. But, you know, it was really one of the, like I said, it was really one of the influences was, you know, when I was a kid, and I watched all those movies, and I thought, &quot;Wow, I want to make movies that have this feel.&quot; And that's what I wanted to do, and when I say, &quot;this feel,&quot; I mean like, you know, I guess it's sort of the feel of early '70s films, but the cool thing about those films, they have their own feel, you know. I mean, they were different, and I]" time="0.706"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0014272276666666666" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Dead Space is a popular sci-fi horror game franchise from Visceral Games and Electronic Arts. In addition to two sequels and several handheld spin-offs, the series also has an animated movie called Dead Space: Aftermath which was released in 2011. The movie is set between the events of Dead Space and Dead Space 2.\n\nThis week, we're looking at the movie's trailer and comparing it to its source material. I've played through the game and watched the movie and will be judging the trailer based on what was included in the movie. I'll only be judging the first 30 seconds of the trailer to get an idea of what to expect from the whole movie.\n\nThe trailer starts with a shot of the U.S.G Ishimura, the ship from Dead Space. In the game, the ship is overrun by the necromorphs and infested with scary creatures. The Ishimura's distress beacon is flashing, indicating it's under attack. However, the ship looks too clean to be infested. It's not enough to see the ship itself, you would have to see the dead bodies and monsters crawling around to get the idea.\n\nNext, we see a number of humans fleeing from something off-screen. In the game, they would be running from the necromorphs that have overrun the Ishimura. Unfortunately, they're all human beings in a space suit. You'd have to be pretty stupid to mistake that for the necromorphs. Plus, there's no one attacking the humans. In the game, there would be an endless amount of monsters chasing after the players. There wouldn't be a calm look to everything.\n\nThe next shot shows an exterior shot of the Ishimura while the camera rotates around it. Again, it's too clean to be infested.\n\nNext, we see a shot of some characters, all looking shocked. Again, there's no reason for this if it's not an infestation. It's a bit like seeing a normal-looking family in a horror movie. No one is scared. In fact, there's no real reason for them to be on the Ishimura, which is supposed to be an extremely dangerous place.\n\nThe next shot shows the captain of the Ishimura, Gibb, running up a long ramp. In the game, the Ishimura is more like a battle station than a ship, so the captain would be in the control room. We then see someone telling Gibb to &quot;get everyone out of here.&quot; This person has to be an important character from the game or a secondary character. But I'm guessing the person is Gibb's secretary. Again, there's no one yelling or crying. In fact, it seems like the only reason for them to be running around is because it's time to leave.\n\nThe last shot shows the Ishimura firing on something.

For example, you may want to track a list of servers, but you don't want your users to be able to add servers, remove servers, or make any other changes to the server list.\n\nThe answer to this problem is to use triggers. You can create triggers that run when a particular type of change is made to the data, and it is possible to make these triggers prevent the data from being changed.\n\nTo create a trigger, you can use the command-line function sqlt. For example, you could write a trigger that prevents a user from removing a particular field from the database.\n\nHere is an example of how you might create a trigger that prevents a user from removing the server_name field from the list of servers:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo CREATE TABLE ListOfServers(name TEXT); CREATE TABLE ListOfIPAddresses(ip_address TEXT); CREATE TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers FOR DELETE AS BEGIN RAISE INFO 'You may not delete the field server_name'; END; SELECT * FROM ListOfServers; name ---------- nameserver1 nameserver2 name ---------- nameserver1 name ---------- nameserver2\n\nThe SQL statement you would use to drop the trigger would look like this:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo DROP TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers; DROP TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers;\n\nNotice that we used the same SQL statement to create and drop the trigger. This is a powerful feature of SQL, which allows you to control exactly when a particular change will occur.\n\nFor example, if you want to remove the server_name field from the database, but you want to retain the data that has already been entered, you could write the trigger as follows:\n\nCREATE TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers FOR DELETE AS BEGIN RAISE INFO 'You may not delete the field server_name'; IF (@old.server_name &lt;&gt; @new.server_name) BEGIN INSERT INTO ListOfIPAddresses VALUES (@old.server_name, NULL); UPDATE ListOfServers SET server_name = NULL WHERE server_name = @old.server_name; END; END;\n\nYou would then delete the field, as follows:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo DELETE server_name FROM ListOfServers; DELETE server_name FROM ListOfServers;\n\nThis example uses the triggers to prevent data from being deleted, but you can use triggers to make other changes as well. You can use the following table to help you determine which commands should be used to insert and delete information:\n\nSQL Command Insert Insert into table Insert into table columns Update Update table Update table columns Delete Delete table Delete table columns]" time="0.310"><properties><property name="score" value="0.02195413" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Perfect!

But this year, things were different. In Apex 2017, he was defeated for the first time since 2015, eliminated in pools by a man that he once conquered: Samuel \u2018Dabuz\u2019 Buzby.\n\nThe question on the minds of many Smash fans was: Why did Dabuz defeat ZeRo, the player who has never been beaten in this game in tournament?\n\nWell, according to Dabuz himself, it was a relatively simple answer.\n\n\u201cI can speak for myself, but one thing that I have definitely noticed is I\u2019ve been playing with a controller for longer,\u201d Dabuz said. \u201cI was playing a lot with the Gamecube controller in 2012 and 2013, and he was mainly playing with the Wii U controller. That\u2019s a big thing, and I think that in general I know how to read his tendencies a little bit better.\u201d\n\nThe controller is a big factor because of the way that Smash for Wii U is played. Because the game was released on the Wii U, it is not played with a controller that has buttons like the PS4 controller, but rather a gamepad with a touchscreen.\n\nZeRo plays with a Gamecube controller with his right hand on the directional pad, and his left hand on the A and B buttons. Because of this, he has to learn the way he plays on that controller and how to switch to it from a standard Wii U gamepad. Dabuz, on the other hand, is more used to the standard controller, which requires more precision and speed to accomplish the same things.\n\nDabuz and ZeRo also play in different regions, which are played on different stages. For example, Dabuz plays on the East Coast, which has the Dream Land stage. This stage is the most neutral stage, and a player who has grown up on that stage would have an edge on a player who was more familiar with the other stages in the game.\n\nZeRo, on the other hand, plays on the West Coast, where the counterpick stages are often Dream Land 64 and Smashville. These stages can change the way a player plays, especially the super defensive style that ZeRo often employs.\n\nThere are also a few other things that can throw a player off their game, including the noises of the crowd and the pressure of being at the top. In a tournament where every person is trying to eliminate you, it can cause even the best to have a momentary lapse in focus and lose a match they should have won.\n\nThese are all things that have affected ZeRo, but they are things that he can get past. Because he is the best, the biggest target and a huge crowd favorite, it is unlikely that the crowd will stop cheering for him any time soon. And when he has a momentary lapse in focus, his playstyle is based around having more than one good option, and his tech skill is such that he can often do something even when he isn\u2019t at his best.\n\nZeRo will be at CEO next week, and this is his chance to reclaim his title as best in the world.\n\nCover photo by Robert Paul via Twitter]" time="0.269"><properties><property name="score" value="0.012546507" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01254651&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01254651

Egli viene da una nobile famiglia e si laurea in teologia presso l\u2019universit\xe0 di Parigi, dove acquisisce una grande dottrina.\n\nIn seguito egli torna alla sua citt\xe0 natale per occuparsi dei suoi affari, ma anche per prendersi cura dei suoi parrocchiani. Viene chiamato a prendere le redini del suo vescovado, allorch\xe9 il precedente vescovo, eletto da Carlo Magno, viene accusato di simonia.\n\nIl vescovo Sisto diviene il successore del suo predecessore dopo esser stato eletto nel 1074. Sotto la sua guida il vescovado cresce e prospera notevolmente.\n\nLa dimostrazione pi\xf9 evidente di questo successo \xe8 la costruzione dell\u2019Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto di Heidenheim, la cui costruzione ha inizio nel 1079, quando Sisto \xe8 vescovo, e termina nel 1092, quando cessa le sue funzioni come vescovo.\n\nAncora oggi si pu\xf2 ammirare questo famoso edificio lungo la strada che va da Heidenheim a N\xf6rdlingen. La sua lunghezza \xe8 di una trentina di chilometri, e il suo diametro di cinque metri.\n\nGli spunti di tale opera li ebbe il vescovo Sisto da tre guerre che furono combattute durante i suoi anni di vescovado, e che hanno luogo, la prima, nell\u2019anno 1077 contro i Tedeschi, la seconda, contro i Bavari nel 1085, e la terza, ancora contro i Bavari, ma questa volta per la conquista della citt\xe0 di Bisanz nel 1092.\n\nIn conseguenza di questi attacchi, il vescovo Sisto fu costretto a rispettare un\u2019astuta tattica militare e ad impiegarla nel campo della politica. Egli fu sempre sul chi vive per quanto riguarda la difesa dei confini del suo territorio.\n\nPer ottenere questo scopo, egli, appoggiato dal vescovo di Bamberga, costru\xec il pi\xf9 grande Aquedotto del suo tempo.\n\nSotto la guida del suo vescovo, il vescovo di Heidenheim, il vescovo di Bamberga ed il vescovo di W\xfcrzburg, si \xe8 provveduto ad avanzare verso i confini nordoccidentali, e i confini dei territori confinanti al nord e ad ovest.\n\nI lavori furono attuati nel campo militare, cos\xec come pure nell\u2019ambito delle arti e delle scienze, perch\xe9 il vescovo Sisto cre\xf2 nel 1078 un\u2019Accademia, a Heidenheim, in cui si studiavano le matematiche e l\u2019astronomia.\n\nIl vescovo Sisto riusc\xec cos\xec a mettere fine alla sua missione e a trasformare Heidenheim in un centro per la conservazione della cultura.\n\nLa costruzione dell\u2019Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto, avvenne attraverso un processo molto interessante.

In the most difficult time of the Cultural Revolution, more than a thousand people self-immolated themselves to death, over five million were violently killed, and an entire country was sacrificed for one man. The self-immolators are committing suicide for what? All of this is being sacrificed for a man.\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u6cb3\u5317\u7701\u5eca\u574a\u5e02\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nSending military troops into Urumqi, letting people starve, shoot, slaughter, etc., the government has long since abandoned any kind of \u201cmaintenance of stability.\u201d But can they face the fact that a few hundred Uyghurs have gone to extremes? This is the embarrassment of the government, a proof that the lives of the Uyghur are worth even less than the government thinks. I\u2019m just hoping that the Uyghur people will gain their own freedom one day.\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u5e7f\u4e1c\u7701\u4f5b\u5c71\u5e02\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nTerrorism and arson.\n\nOnly a thief is afraid of fire.\n\nThe history of the burning of books in the East is the same as that of the burning of witches in the West.\n\nThe responsibility of the Uyghurs is in the hands of the government and the people of China.\n\nIf the people of China can be unified, if the government can be clear, it will not be as it is now, nor will it have the effects of spreading instability throughout the world.\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u7f8e\u56fd\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nThe most important thing in the Uyghurs\u2019 lives is the love for their children and themselves, as the life of one\u2019s family is the foundation of all things. This is how the Uyghurs are, and this is the reason why they fight back, and this is why they do what they do.\n\nFor example, the government forcibly inserts women into the Uyghur\u2019s households and forces them to wear head scarves, it forcibly strips the children from their families and rears them in \u201corphanages,\u201d forcibly rips young girls from their parents\u2019 arms to be sent to Tibet, forcibly controls the number of children Uyghurs are allowed to have, forcibly forces Uyghurs to go to Han villages, forcibly encourages them to go to work in the cities, forcibly puts Han businesses into Uyghur homes, forcibly buys out their livestock and agricultural fields to build industrial parks, forcibly forces Uyghur young people to go to school to study and the rest are to go to do factory work, forcibly builds supermarkets, shops, hotels, etc., which gives them no chance to get employment, forcibly makes it so that Uyghur young people can\u2019t find a spouse to get married and have children, forcibly demolishes their houses and forces them to move to another area, forcibly blocks them from having religious activities, etc., etc., the Uyghurs are continuously being forced to endure.\n\nIf you look at the Uyghur protests from a perspective of someone observing them, you can understand how it all began and why it has continued to this day.\n\nThe government has no choice but to take all this, because the Uyghurs are a minority group with nothing to back them up and their lot is really not the greatest.\n\nOn the other hand, if the government wants to go easy on the Uyghurs, this might also lead to the Uyghurs feeling discontent with the government, so it has to be a careful balancing act.\n\nYou know, because of this constant bickering, the government can no longer help the Uyghurs, because it\u2019s already using all its energy to help the Han, which is what it cares about most.\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u6e56\u5317\u7701\u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nIf the man really did self-immolate because of the fines, isn\u2019t that a little too extreme? If he had used this method before, it could be understood. But he\u2019s done this only now, this means that he\u2019s only using this method for his own ends. What does this mean? How can people kill themselves and turn themselves into such an extreme protest against injustice? Who are the ones to blame?\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nI am just trying to understand, he set himself on fire to fight over a traffic violation?\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u7f8e\u56fd\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nWhen the time comes, there will only be Uyghur resistance and nothing else.\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u6e56\u5357\u7701\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nJust look at this, everyone. The Uyghurs have their own methods of protest and methods of expressing their wishes and opinions, which have nothing to do with us.\n\nSo can we stop always picking on them and accusing them of terrorist actions? What they are doing is simply that they are using extreme methods to express their unhappiness and discontent, but I hope that they will consider the extreme actions of their people and act in accordance with the situation in China.\n\nI would like to ask everyone, what do you think?\n\nI believe the true thinking of the masses should be understood.\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u9655\u897f\u7701\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nWhat a shame, they have this kind of personality and they\u2019re so different from us.

In her &quot;Garwoodesque&quot; style, she takes on a contemporary setting, but her attention to detail and superb research remains. If you've read her works in the past, you will find this new one to be in keeping with her other works.\n\n\n\nThe story takes place in modern day Scotland. Lucinda Ashton's family has had it rough for the past two years. Her father has been suffering from an incurable illness, her mother's nerves are beginning to show, and her twin brothers are both leaving for college and working part time jobs to help with the family expenses. But, it is her brother Duncan who she is most worried about. Duncan has always been her hero. The oldest and most handsome of the Ashton boys, she has watched him for years make the right choices and resist temptation. Lucinda wants to be a lawyer. But her parents are barely able to feed and cloth their five children, so Lucinda has had to abandon her dreams of higher education. Lucinda is determined to help her parents and her siblings. She will sell her beautiful pearl necklace so she can pay for her brothers' educations and alleviate some of her parents' financial burden.\n\n\n\nDuncan is thrilled to be going to university in Edinburgh.

He was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Sinn F\xe9in.\n\nErskine Hamilton Childers was born in England in 1870, the eldest son of Robert Erskine Childers, a British Army officer and later a writer and political theorist.\n\nIn the course of his lifetime he spelled his surname in a number of different ways, including Childers and Childs.\n\nChilders attended school at Stubbington House, Fareham. At the age of 16 he became a clerk in a Southampton shipping office. He joined the Liberal Party and became a political speaker on its behalf. In 1899 he was elected as a councillor to Southampton County Borough Council.\n\nHe married Molly Zichy-Woinarski (sister of Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Zichy-Woinarski) in 1908, but had no children.\n\nChilders was a keen yachtsman, and in 1906, with Sir Thomas Lipton, he set up the Shamrock IV syndicate to challenge for the Americas Cup.\n\nHe participated in the unsuccessful Irish Convention of 1917\u20131918, a body established by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George which negotiated an agreement with Irish representatives in an attempt to end the period of Irish nationalist insurrection. The Convention, which met at Dublin Castle, made a number of suggestions regarding the governance of Ireland, which were partially incorporated into the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It was Childers, who, in September 1917, raised the need for a &quot;conversation&quot; between Irish and British leaders.\n\nAfter the Easter Rising of 1916, and his arrest for involvement, Childers helped reorganise the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) in an effort to steer it towards constitutional activity and away from militancy.\n\nIn the 1918 general election, Childers stood as a Sinn F\xe9in candidate in Wicklow. Although he did not win the seat, he polled well and the Sinn F\xe9in party decided to nominate him as one of its members of the Irish delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. It was at the Paris Peace Conference that he met Arthur Griffith and became a convinced Irish republican.\n\nHe became a committed supporter of Arthur Griffith's Sinn F\xe9in party. In 1919, he was arrested and charged with sedition, because of his support of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).\n\nHe was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\xe9in Teachta D\xe1la (TD) to the 2nd D\xe1il at the 1921 elections for the Dublin Mid constituency. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, and became a member of the Irish Free State Seanad in 1922.\n\nHe became the fourth President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (i.e. prime minister) in June 1921, and on 26 June 1921 he was appointed to the office of President of the Republic, (which was to become that of President of the Executive Council on the enactment of the 1922 Constitution in August 1922).\n\nIn 1921, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 split the island into two autonomous territories within the United Kingdom: the six north-eastern counties became Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland became Southern Ireland, governed by the Irish Free State government in Dublin. However, the Parliament of Northern Ireland chose to opt out of the Free State in 1922. Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, this meant that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State, but the British refused to accept this, saying it would lead to the &quot;break-up of the United Kingdom&quot;. The Irish Taoiseach and President of the Executive Council (prime minister), W. T. Cosgrave, insisted that the British had breached the Treaty and that the Free State had the right to &quot;withdraw from the British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;, but he chose not to use this option. Instead, he demanded that the Northern Ireland government do so, and thus abolish itself.\n\nChilders was shot dead in his home on Inishmore, Aran Islands, County Galway, in November 1922, two months after becoming President. The following January, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; reported that Michael Noyk, the Russian Consul in Galway, and Joseph Murray, a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, were both implicated in his murder.

Williams established herself as an activist, fighting for women's suffrage, juvenile delinquency, and public health. Williams was well known for her innovative and groundbreaking approaches to improving the quality of life for children, the public, and the underprivileged. Williams began working for the New York City Health Department in 1918, and in 1925 she became the director of the Bureau of Child Guidance. Williams was the only woman in the country with such a position at the time, and held the position until her death in 1951.\n\nSarah Williams was born in 1880 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second child of James Williams, a grocer and later a dentist, and Ella Burt Williams. At age 10, she attended the Powelton Avenue School in Philadelphia, and by age 12 she had already decided that she wanted to be a teacher. At age 13, Williams attended the Girls' High School and excelled academically. She took part in school plays and oratorical contests, and upon graduation, Williams attended Swarthmore College in 1896. Williams majored in Greek and Latin and continued to study oratorical contests and plays. After graduating in 1900, Williams continued her education at Cornell University, where she studied American History and Economics. While studying at Cornell, Williams became a member of the college women's debating team, which would later become a hobby for her. Upon graduation, Williams pursued graduate studies at Columbia University, where she received her M.A. degree in Social Science in 1907. At Columbia, Williams received one of her most important honors, the Demorest Fellowship. After graduation, Williams decided to enter the field of social work.\n\nAfter receiving her Master's Degree, Williams began to work as a social worker in Philadelphia. While working in Philadelphia, Williams became interested in the idea of juvenile courts, and worked to improve them. Williams began traveling to study different models of juvenile courts and while in London, she visited the Infant Welfare and the Juvenile Probation Departments. While visiting a British Probation Home, Williams became interested in the training of child welfare workers. She returned to the United States and started a training program for juvenile probation officers in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1911, Williams accepted a job as the chief social worker of the Infant Welfare Association of Philadelphia. In 1915, Williams moved to New York City and accepted a position as the executive secretary of the Child Labor Committee.

Most are deeply religious, but the few who aren't still serve their groups or causes with fanatical zeal. The paladin is essentially a warrior of the gods, and most spend their lives wandering the world of Oerth, aiding those they deem good or just. Although a paladin will fight to slay a horde of monsters or a mad king, he will not do so out of a lust for battle or destruction, but out of a need to keep the forces of darkness at bay.\n\nPaladins are renowned for their bravery, their unyielding dedication to the principles of good, and their mastery of martial arms. It is rare to find an evil paladin.\n\nAbilities: Strength and Charisma are both prime requisites for a paladin. Strength is his prime requisite, followed by Charisma. Strength governs how hard a paladin can hit, how effectively he can wear armor, and his carrying capacity. Charisma governs the strength of his spells and the DC's of his class skills. A paladin must be lawful good.\n\nHit Die: d10\n\nStarting Age: Complex.\n\nStarting Gold: Complex.\n\nClass Skills\n\nThe paladin's class skills are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).\n\nSkill Points at First Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.\n\nSkill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.\n\nClass Features\n\nAll of the following are class features of the paladin.\n\nWeapon and Armor Proficiency: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).\n\nAura of Good (Ex): The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.\n\nDetect Evil (Sp): At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.\n\nSmite Evil (Su): Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.\n\nIn addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.\n\nThe smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.\n\nDivine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.\n\nLay on Hands (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs one free hand to use this ability.\n\nAlternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.\n\nAura of Courage (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.\n\nDivine Health (Ex): At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.\n\nDivine Bond (Sp): Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.\n\nThe first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level.

It is an essential component in wheeled vehicles, providing a convenient way to deal with irregularities in the road surface.\n\nMost modern vehicles are fitted with some sort of suspension. It is the primary means of isolating the passengers from the road, as well as absorbing the bumps and vibrations from the road.\n\nThe suspension system on a vehicle provides the following functions:\n\nThere are many systems available that provide all or most of these functions, but most can be categorized by their design and motion characteristics.\n\nThe simplest suspension systems are rigid, and often called &quot;hard suspensions&quot;, because they don't use any fluid damping. Instead, they rely entirely on the elasticity of the metal or the springiness of the suspension elements to soak up the bumps. Some early vehicles used torsion springs as suspension, but modern systems almost all use either coil or leaf springs, or shock absorbers.\n\nThe first and simplest suspension system was used by the French inventor of the wheel, Leonardo da Vinci. It consisted of four flexible limbs connected to the carriage. These limbs served as both the suspension and steering system.\n\nIn addition, Leonardo designed a system that included advanced features such as brake linings, bearings and a double-action brake system. A suspension system for cars was introduced by M. Thon in France in 1898. It consisted of a network of rubber bands that took the place of conventional springs. The rubber bands were enclosed in a conventional coil-spring housing. An advantage of this system was its light weight. Thon's design was introduced to the United States by John M. Curtis in 1904.\n\nBy the 1920s, many independent suspension manufacturers were using the pneumatic springing system as the basis of their systems, as well as using rubber or steel cords for springing. The principal disadvantage of the pneumatic system is that the spring-pressure increases with the compression of the suspension. In addition, a system that is not correctly adjusted will not ride well.\n\nThe third kind of suspension system was developed by the Morgan Motor Company, based in the UK. In this system, the spring is attached to the frame, and the shock absorbers are attached to a special hub, which attaches to the front and rear axles. This system is still sometimes seen in modern cars, since it is less expensive than the other systems and in most cases provides an adequate ride. This system has not been popular in Europe and North America since the 1930s.\n\nThe most common suspension system in modern cars, used in everything from Ford Model Ts to the Chevrolet Corvette, is the &quot;independent front suspension&quot;, or &quot;live axle&quot;. In this system, the suspension is a more or less conventional system of springs and shock absorbers, with the additional feature of a locating link (the king pin in an axle-based suspension). This allows the axle to move up and down relative to the chassis. The locating link ends are attached to the car body, which provides the rolling element to the system.\n\nThe other feature of this system is the axle, which provides the pivoting element of the suspension system. The wheel hub is attached to the ends of the axle, and the wheel itself is attached to the hub. The spring system, located in the body of the vehicle, is attached to the axle via the locating link. The body of the car, therefore, provides the &quot;pivot&quot; of the suspension.\n\nA number of variations on this design have been used, most notably independent rear suspension, in which the rear wheels are located by a trailing arm (a form of wishbone) instead of the traditional transverse leaf spring. Another design commonly found on trucks is the &quot;live rear axle&quot;. In this system, the axle is located by an arm from the leaf spring. The rear wheels can move up and down relative to the chassis without any location from the body.\n\nA design commonly used on many racing cars and on some passenger cars is the DeDion or De Dion suspension, named after its inventors, the De Dion brothers. In this system, the two wheels are located by a triangular or &quot;semi-trapezoidal&quot; bar. The pivot is provided by a bearing block mounted to the car body, while the pivoting point for the wheels is a ball joint on the axle.\n\nThe DeDion design is an expensive design, due to the cost of the wheels, brakes and other parts. However, it does provide excellent wheel location, as the wheels can be moved by several inches in any direction without affecting the steering.\n\nRacing cars generally use the DeDion system, as the location of the wheels is the primary function of the suspension system. However, it is also used on a number of sports cars, including the Jaguar XK120, the Maserati 3500 GT and the Lamborghini Gallardo.\n\nOne of the main disadvantages of the DeDion suspension is that the front wheels are not located directly above the chassis, and there is significant scrub radius. For example, a wheelbase of 86\xa0inches (218\xa0cm) on a vehicle with a wheel diameter of 18\xa0inches (46\xa0cm) would produce a scrub radius of around 8\xa0inches (20\xa0cm). This can cause the car to steer and corner differently depending on the tire wear, since the scrub radius is at its largest when the tires are new.\n\nWhile an advantage of the DeDion system is that it is lighter than a comparable design, this is not a major consideration for racing cars. However, since racing cars are generally not driven at high speeds for long distances, the &quot;chassis bounce&quot; caused by the scrub radius is not an issue.\n\nOne of the first types of suspension system was introduced by Earle Crooker and was called &quot;Independent Coil Spring Suspension&quot;. It was a brand name that existed only in the late 1920s. The name was used by C. G. Ames Co.\n\nIn this system, the springs are attached directly to the frame. In this system, the wheel is attached to the axle, which is supported by a bearing attached to the frame, not the car body.\n\nThe primary advantage of this system is the ease with which the wheelbase can be changed. In most cars, the wheels are located by a link that is attached to the axle and the frame, and the wheels can move relative to the car body. In this system, there is a much smaller length change, as the wheels move up and down relative to the axle.\n\nThe disadvantage of this system is that the body is no longer a &quot;pivot point&quot; for the suspension. The body is now part of the suspension system. This makes it very difficult to change the camber of the wheels (i.e., the angle of the wheel relative to the car body). In addition, the wheel can only move in one plane, as the upper control arm and the lower control arm limit the movement of the wheel. The car may need to be aligned more often, as the geometry of the suspension can change more than a suspension system where the wheels move relative to the body.\n\nThis system is commonly found on American cars built in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the Nash Ambassador, Hudson, and other brands. It is less commonly found on European cars, although it was used on some Mercedes-Benz models]" time="0.626"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0149004365" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[L\u2019avvento di Zuckerberg ha definitivamente maturato il passaggio dalla televisione tradizionale a quella digitale.

The aim of the project is to help these rough sleepers access the appropriate support services, whether it be residential or non-residential. The campaign highlights the issue of rough sleeping in Dublin city, which is rising at an alarming rate, with an increase of over 40% in the number of people living on the streets since 2013. The campaign\u2019s focus is on raising awareness of this issue.\n\nThe campaign involves advertisements on the city\u2019s LUAS and Dublin Bus, as well as featuring on O\u2019Connell Street, Portobello and Talbot Streets. It also involves the installation of posters across the city, specifically in locations where the homeless are more likely to reside.\n\nSpeaking at the campaign launch, Minister Flanagan said: \u201cRough sleeping has reached record levels and has become a visible problem in our capital city. The launch of this campaign will increase awareness of the services provided by the Crosscare Pathways Project to rough sleepers, so that they are aware of the options available to them. Rough sleepers should be referred to the services that will best suit their needs. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am particularly concerned to ensure that rough sleepers are not penalised for begging and sleeping on the streets.\n\n\u201cThe Government is determined to prevent and reduce homelessness, to support rough sleepers to exit homelessness, and to prevent homelessness for others at risk. Over \u20ac70 million has been provided to support homeless services and prevent homelessness, which includes funding to frontline services such as the Crosscare Pathways Project, who work to prevent rough sleeping by providing outreach support to rough sleepers.\u201d\n\nMinister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar said: \u201cThe \u2018Living On The Streets\u2019 campaign brings home the reality that the street is a harsh and unforgiving place to be, particularly during the winter months. The response from the public will be crucial if we are to address this problem effectively.\n\n\u201cThere are over 1,000 rough sleepers in Dublin city and unfortunately this is a significant increase on previous years. That is why it is so important that we engage the public, using this campaign as an opportunity to highlight the services available to rough sleepers, including the Crosscare Pathways Project. It is a complex problem that requires a complex response, involving a number of different organisations, as well as a societal change in attitude.\n\n\u201cWith the help of my colleague, Minister Flanagan, we have increased funding for the homeless to \u20ac70 million this year, which will provide more than 3,000 more beds in a wide variety of services. We have also agreed to provide an additional \u20ac5 million over the next two years.\u201d\n\nCrosscare Pathways Project is a national organisation with local services based in Ballymun, Jobstown, Dublin city centre, Trim, Waterford and Wexford. It provides a range of services to homeless people and others at risk of homelessness, as well as people sleeping rough, particularly those sleeping on the streets of Dublin. The Crosscare Pathways Project also provides services for homeless people in Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin North, Dublin South and Dublin West.\n\nThe project\u2019s services include outreach services, sleeping bags, socks, warm clothes, food, clothing, showers, laundry and toiletries.\n\nThe campaign is the work of the cross-agency Dublin Central Area Partnership (DCAP), which is comprised of An Garda S\xedoch\xe1na, Dublin City Council, Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE), Dublin Fire Brigade, Dublin Regional Housing Executive (DRHE), Dublin Street Pastors, Homeless Hotline, Irish Red Cross, Samaritans, Simon Community and Street Reach.\n\nThe campaign is supported by a number of major partners including Dublin City Council, Bus \xc9ireann, Dublin Bus, Dublin Airport Authority, Transdev and Luas Cross City.\n\nENDS]" time="0.353"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0048067295" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00480673&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00480673

Some people may not have noticed the second fact. Over here, the NHS is now the NHS 2.0, or 3.0, or whatever they are on to. We\u2019re getting used to the idea that it will always be changing, and changing in ways we\u2019re not in total control of.\n\nWith my dry British sense of humor, I\u2019ve always enjoyed the NHS. In fact, I like it so much that I even thought of emigrating to a country with an NHS \u2013 like, say, the USA. So what a treat to discover in my in-box this morning a compilation of jokes, half of them at the expense of the USA and half at the expense of the UK, about health-care reform.\n\nFrom London, Chris Salisbury compiled them, and here are a couple of samples. The first is about healthcare reform in the USA:\n\n\u201cHave you heard about the new Congressional Health Care plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the government\u2019s going to give you half of what it takes away.\u201d\n\nAnd the second, about the NHS:\n\nA man is at the doctor\u2019s office, and the doctor tells him, \u201cI\u2019ve got some good news and some bad news for you.\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t take the bad news right now, so give me the good news first.\u201d\n\nThe doctor says, \u201cWell, the good news is that you have an 18-inch penis.\u201d\n\nThe man looks stunned for a moment, and then asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d\n\nThe doctor says, \u201cYour brain\u2019s in your dick.\u201d\n\nThese jokes may be inaccurate, of course. For example, the doctors\u2019 pay packets are pretty great, and some of them can do much better work in the US than in Britain. But one thing I know is for sure: it\u2019s great to see the NHS getting some serious attention in the American media.

I believe that there\u2019s something for everyone to enjoy, as the author does such a great job of portraying the characters in all their strengths and flaws. Sometimes they go a little over the top with the angst, and it isn\u2019t very realistic, but I understand why. There are authors who never experience any type of conflict with their characters, and the books just feel very one dimensional. Some books can have some really crappy endings, but I have learned to stay away from books that end with the couple together and happy but someone was murdered or something along those lines. I don\u2019t care for books that have the couple separated, but they\u2019ll come back together in the end.\n\nWhat I want in a good romance book is a good, if not a great, ending that makes me feel good, no matter what happens to the characters. As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t like books that end in tragedy, and they usually do end in tragedy. There are some that aren\u2019t too tragic, but they just aren\u2019t the endings that I like. This is where the author\u2019s job becomes very difficult. They have to give the reader a reason to feel the way they want them to feel about the characters. If they feel bad, they\u2019ve done their job. If they feel happy, they\u2019ve done their job. As a reader, I\u2019m not looking to be outraged, nor am I looking to be happy. I\u2019m just looking for something that makes me feel.\n\nOn the flip side of that, I know a lot of people don\u2019t want to be emotionally manipulated. They just want to read a book and enjoy it. They don\u2019t want to be forced to feel one way or another. They want to feel neutral. Neutral, to me, is a huge accomplishment in a romance novel. To me, a romance novel has to be able to get a person, even if they don\u2019t think it will, to feel something for the characters. In most books, people want to know how they can make a particular character do what they want them to do. In a romance novel, that\u2019s the main character. They want to know how they can make the characters fall in love, because they see themselves in one or both of them. How would they do it? How would they fix it?\n\nThat is what a reader does when they read a romance novel. They want to know how to fix the problems that the characters have. This is why the ending is so important. It has to make the reader happy, but not to the point where they roll their eyes or feel like they were taken for a ride. I have a great example. In the movie Now and Then, a woman tells her daughter that she is happy. When her daughter tells her that she is, too, she tells her that it\u2019s because they\u2019re both lying. They don\u2019t want to make each other sad, so they\u2019re lying to each other. This is the exact thing that happens in a lot of romance novels, in my opinion. They\u2019re trying to make the readers feel good, but in the process they\u2019re lying. To me, the ending has to make the reader feel what the author was trying to make them feel, not what they want them to feel.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that the book has to end the way I want it to. What I\u2019m saying is that I want the author to be honest. I want them to give me a believable ending that isn\u2019t just thrown together so that they can end the book. I want the ending to mean something, and I think that\u2019s what most readers want. Most people like to be happy, and a good book will give them that. The ending has to be good enough that the reader doesn\u2019t feel like they wasted their time, but also good enough that they\u2019re not completely disappointed. They have to be happy with the story, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly what they wanted.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite romance book endings?]" time="0.312"><properties><property name="score" value="0.016885994" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[There\u2019s nothing more adorable than a real life couple who gush over one another on social media and share the same love story.

While not naming China, the intended target of that policy was clear. The Chinese government, on the other hand, was not impressed.\n\nWriting in the English-language edition of China Daily on Monday, Ma Kai, vice-premier of the State Council, or China's cabinet, and chair of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), countered the Trump administration's position by arguing that China has been the most open to foreign investment in the world for the past three decades.\n\nIn Ma's view, China is playing by the rules of free trade. The problem is that the rules that America wants are not the same rules that America has been playing by. The United States wants to be able to sell its goods and services into China, but it wants to block Chinese goods and services from being sold in America.\n\nSpecifically, Ma pointed to the issue of the U.S. $347 billion trade deficit with China, which is the focus of a U.S. investigation to determine whether China's government has unfairly subsidized certain industries.\n\nBut China is not subsidizing its industries, according to Ma. The U.S. trade deficit is simply a function of America's industrial overcapacity and under-consumption, as well as Chinese market and regulatory restrictions on certain industries.\n\nIn Ma's view, there is an easy solution to the trade deficit, and that is to allow China to import more agricultural products, textiles, and auto parts from the United States.\n\nThis is not the first time Ma has been forced to explain the Chinese position in the ongoing trade war. Last week, he held an hour-long interview with Charlie Rose, the television host. In the interview, Ma also said that he would not criticize the Trump administration for the position it is taking. Instead, he is simply trying to point out to the Trump administration that it is China that has been working toward a free trade regime, and that the American government has not been as open as the Chinese government has been in allowing Chinese companies to invest in American businesses.\n\nWhat Ma is really doing is not simply trying to engage in a debate about the nature of free trade, but to make sure that Americans understand how the Chinese government is fighting to protect its own economy from the American tariffs, while at the same time, maintaining a narrative of the mutual benefits of free trade.\n\nMa's interview with Charlie Rose can be viewed here:]" time="0.468"><properties><property name="score" value="0.18100971" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.18100971&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.18100971

China has been actively preparing for the summit and has invested in the improvement of its infrastructure and public services. However, the relationship between China and the US has deteriorated in the past few weeks. The US has asked the WTO to look into what it describes as unfair treatment of US companies in China. Furthermore, the EU, the US and Japan have called for retaliatory measures against China, after the announcement of a new Chinese law to allow China to bypass international patents. On the other hand, there are indications that the Chinese government will relax foreign ownership restrictions in its auto industry, and also encourage the outflow of capital from the country. The theme of the summit is &quot;Better Growth, Better World&quot;, and the three themes will be &quot;growth&quot;, &quot;inclusive growth&quot;, and &quot;sustainable growth&quot;.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the World Bank, China has a great economic potential, yet faces severe challenges. These challenges include maintaining the economic growth, the management of urbanisation, the fight against corruption, the increasing inequality and the aging population. On the other hand, the report also concludes that China has the opportunity to become a major contributor to global growth, thanks to the fact that China is an important producer of capital, the country is growing in the manufacturing sector, and is also important in terms of consumption, which is expected to grow by more than 6% this year. The report also highlights the fact that China has been the biggest contributor to the global GDP growth in the last 15 years, with a contribution of 30%.\n\nOn the other hand, China is also a top trading partner of the US, with trade between the two countries amounting to more than $600 billion. Therefore, the potential of a trade war between the US and China would be dramatic. As the leaders of the two countries are gathering in the same city, the G20 summit will be an opportunity to address many of the issues between the two countries. As an example, the summit will discuss the sustainability of trade, both for exports and imports.\n\nIt seems that the US and China may be heading towards a trade war. If such a trade war will occur, it will have devastating consequences on both the US and Chinese economies, as well as on the global economy. Furthermore, the WTO may face a severe problem, as it would probably have to be the court of the two parties involved in the trade war. Thus, the G20 summit will be an important meeting and will represent a key opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to reach an agreement.]" time="0.310"><properties><property name="score" value="0.03421068" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Takes place three months after the events of Season 4, 'Brother's Keeper'.\n\nMax and Liz's lives were put on hold after George's tragic death, but now that the madness of the wedding season has passed, they're finally ready to start their life together.

They're finally back to their normal routine.\n\nExcept now, it's not.\n\nNow it's crazy.\n\nMax and Liz are supposed to be getting ready to take their first vacation in a very long time, but it turns out Liz isn't feeling up to it. She has a persistent cough, she's not sleeping well, and she's even started getting headaches. Max tries to be supportive as she talks about calling their doctor, but the more she says it, the more certain he becomes that something is seriously wrong.\n\nAnd then Liz stops talking. She won't talk to the doctor on the phone, she won't talk to Max, and she won't talk to the doctor when he comes to their apartment. She just smiles politely and lies to the doctor's face about how she's been feeling, and then makes Max drive her home as soon as the appointment is over.\n\nMax finally gets her to talk to him once they get home, but she can't tell him what's wrong. She just says that she's been feeling off, and doesn't know why. She refuses to go to the hospital, and eventually falls asleep on the couch, leaving Max alone to think about the phone call he has to make the next day.\n\nHe tells Hank, and his mind immediately goes to the worst case scenario. It doesn't help that when he went to visit Liz earlier, he saw a few of the guys from work lurking around outside their apartment. He had a feeling they weren't just paying him a social call.\n\nHe ends up calling Hank at two in the morning, rambling and stuttering and eventually saying it all in one long string of words. When he's done, Hank doesn't even need to tell him he was right.\n\nThe next day, Max wakes up to find Liz looking better than she has in weeks. There's a huge smile on her face, and she looks so happy. He's thrilled to see her finally feeling better, but he can't help but wonder if she's just hiding the fact that she's sicker than ever.\n\nHe can't bring himself to ask.\n\nShe starts working on her first assignment with a new partner a few days later. This new partner's name is Adam, and he seems like a pretty nice guy. Max watches Liz interact with him and can't help but wonder if he's doing the right thing by keeping her away from the wedding business. He knows how much she loves the job, and this is the first time he's seen her truly smile in a while.\n\nOf course, he doesn't get the chance to mention that to her. The moment he opens his mouth, she cuts him off and says she has a date with Adam.\n\nLiz goes on a date with Adam, and comes home late again. Max's heart sinks when she opens the door and he sees the smile on her face. It's not her usual smile, the one she saves for Max. It's the smile she reserves for Chompy and her art, and it's a smile he hasn't seen in a long time.\n\nMax knows what he's supposed to do, and he knows what's best for Liz. He knows that keeping her away from the wedding business is the best thing he can do for her. But he can't bring himself to do it.\n\nHe still isn't sure how she's going to take it when he tells her.\n\n&quot;Oh my god,&quot; she says, and Max's breath catches in his throat.\n\nHe doesn't get a chance to tell her that he's sorry.\n\nShe rushes off the bed and takes the two steps necessary to cross the room. She throws her arms around him, and Max's whole body tenses at the unexpected contact. He can feel her shaking in his arms, and the sound of her sobs echo through his apartment.\n\nShe tells him she loves him, and he tells her that he loves her too. She pulls away, and he can see the tears streaming down her face. She says that she has to go, and he knows he has to tell her what he did.\n\nHe knows she'll be angry with him, and he's not sure how she's going to react.\n\nShe kisses him on the cheek, and then disappears out the door.\n\nHe doesn't go after her.\n\nMax calls Liz the next day, and tells her to come over to his apartment. She's silent the entire drive, and he's not sure what she's going to do when she walks in.\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he says, and she freezes in the middle of the living room.\n\n&quot;I have something to tell you,&quot; he says, &quot;and I'm going to need you to promise me that you'll stay calm.&quot;\n\nShe gives him a slow nod, and he knows she's not going to like what he's about to say.\n\n&quot;I called Hank, and I told him that you were sick. That's why you haven't been going to work. I told him that you needed to take some time off, because you had a really serious case of strep throat.&quot;\n\nShe opens her mouth to say something, but he interrupts her and keeps going.\n\n&quot;He didn't want to believe me at first, but I convinced him. I told him that it wasn't a big deal, but he needs to know if you start showing signs of weakness. He's going to call in a few days to check up on you.

In particular we consider the following problems: the serial position effect, the order effect, the semantic (in)sensitivity, and the distance effect.\n\nFigure 6.16 shows an example of text results of three sequences of three sentences. The whole process of filling and querying a WBS model is shown in Figure 6.17.\n\nWe can observe that in all three sequences the first sentence (\u201cA citizen of A is driving a car\u201d) is more frequently retrieved than the second sentence (\u201cA citizen of B is driving a car\u201d). The number of retentions for the first sentence is also higher than the number of retrievals for the second sentence, which can be attributed to the lexical and syntactic differences between these two sentences.\n\nAnother common problem in short sentences is the inter-sentence association: if a WBS model is designed to store sentences and not words, then the grammatical order of the sentences is kept in the model. Thus, the sentences that have the same word but a different order in the two sentences will be retrieved as if they had the same word. Figure 6.18 shows an example of sentences with the same words but a different order. As expected, the same sentences will have a higher number of retentions than the same words in the same order.\n\nThe serial position effect can be observed when words that occur in a specific position in the sentences are more retrieved than the same words that occur in different positions. This effect can be attributed to the influence of the semantic context on the recognition of the words that are at the same position in different sentences, and the words that are not in the same position have a different semantic context that makes them not to be recognized as if they were in the same position. Figure 6.19 shows an example of sentences with the same words in the same order but with a different position in each sentence. In this example, the word \u201cof\u201d in the position 5 of the first sentence is more retrieved than the same word in the position 7 of the second sentence, and the word \u201cof\u201d in the position 3 of the second sentence is more retrieved than the same word in the position 6 of the third sentence. This effect is more noticeable when the word \u201cof\u201d is repeated.\n\nIn this section, we present the results of a search on the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) [44] with the retrieved words and their respective sentences in a sentence. For each sentence, the average of the values of the retrieval frequencies for all the words in the sentence is computed.

It was the seventh round of the 2010 Formula One season. The 60-lap race was won by Red Bull driver Mark Webber, after he started from second position. Lewis Hamilton finished second for the McLaren team and Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso came in third.\n\nPirelli's prime tyre compound was the hard &quot;primes&quot;, whilst the option tyre was the soft &quot;option&quot; compound.\n\nMark Webber took pole position for Red Bull, his first since the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix, while Fernando Alonso set the fastest time in Q2 and qualified second. The two Ferraris filled the next row with Felipe Massa ahead of Kimi R\xe4ikk\xf6nen. The two McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button were fifth and sixth, with Nico Rosberg in seventh place, having struggled all weekend with the handling of his Mercedes. Adrian Sutil in the Force India was eighth, followed by Sebastian Vettel in the second Red Bull and Nico H\xfclkenberg in the Williams. Paul di Resta, S\xe9bastien Buemi and Michael Schumacher rounded out the top ten. At the start, Mark Webber led away from Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa while the two McLarens of Hamilton and Jenson Button slipped backwards, with Hamilton eventually being forced to pit with an electrical problem, and Button dropping to eleventh. Mark Webber's race soon went wrong as he came into the pit lane to switch to his wet weather tyres on lap 11, but was told to remain in his pit box as he had not switched off his engine, having forgotten to do so. This meant he was stationary for 23 seconds and dropped to fourth, before recovering to third by the time he rejoined the circuit. He also had to serve a drive-through penalty for passing Alonso on the grass, although he eventually finished fourth.\n\nAlonso and Massa pitted on laps 18 and 22 respectively, rejoining in second and third places behind the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton, who had made an early pit stop for dry tyres and was running a different strategy to the two Ferraris. With the track still wet, Hamilton, Massa and Alonso all switched to the intermediate tyres on lap 25, but at this point, the gap between the top three was only 1.3 seconds. The McLarens of Hamilton and Button were then unable to pass the Ferraris on the drying track and they began to slip backwards, eventually losing their fourth and fifth places to the two Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta. The latter had passed Sutil on the main straight on lap 30 after the Force India driver had made a pit stop and had a clear track in front of him, and held on to fifth place despite being passed by Sutil a few laps later. The two Toro Rossos of Jaime Alguersuari and S\xe9bastien Buemi were the first of the lead lap cars to pit on lap 28, with Alguersuari dropping behind Rosberg in the standings after pitting earlier than the Mercedes driver. The other Toro Rosso of Sebastien Buemi managed to stay out longer and maintained his eighth place, before making a pit stop at the end of lap 34.\n\nFurther back, Jenson Button was the first of the two McLarens to pit for new tyres on lap 33, with a nine-second stop due to an electronics problem with the wheel gun which meant the front left tyre was not fitted correctly. Team-mate Lewis Hamilton followed suit a lap later and rejoined the race in twelfth place. Button rejoined the race behind S\xe9bastien Buemi and passed him on lap 36, but was behind Adrian Sutil when he stopped for fresh tyres on lap 38, although Button was able to pass Sutil a few laps later, with Buemi also getting ahead of the Force India.

Bushmaster was also the head of the ruthless Bushmaster drug cartel.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nNot much is known about John Bushmaster's early life, except that he was once involved in organized crime. He became a drug lord and took over his brother's position as head of Harlem's Paradise. He later became involved in the criminal organization known as the Hand.[1]\n\nLuke Cage's Power\n\n&quot;Tell me where they took Misty Knight.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are you going to do with me?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, I'm not going to let you walk away.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who's going to stop me?&quot;\n\n&quot;Luke Cage.&quot; \u2015Luke Cage and Bushmaster [src]\n\nWhen Bushmaster witnessed Luke Cage throw a man out of Harlem's Paradise for harassing some young women, he asked his brother, Quincy, to help him get rid of the unruly patron. The next day, Bushmaster called the man who was threatening to sue Harlem's Paradise and threatened to kill him. When Cage returned, Bushmaster tried to persuade Cage to leave by telling him he did not belong there. Bushmaster revealed to Cage that his name was John Bushmaster and that he was the owner of Harlem's Paradise. When Cage insisted that he would be staying, Bushmaster noted that he did not know who he was messing with before Cage told him he was messing with Luke Cage.\n\nCage remained in Harlem's Paradise and caused problems for Bushmaster, much to his annoyance. Bushmaster and his men began selling the Bushmaster drug throughout Harlem. Cage overheard Bushmaster's name when it was said by his brother Quincy during a phone call. When Cage visited Bushmaster at Harlem's Paradise and accused him of being behind the Bushmaster drug, he denied it and told Cage to leave. Bushmaster's men, however, confronted Cage and attacked him. Cage easily overpowered all of them and escaped from Harlem's Paradise.[1]\n\nChasing Misty Knight\n\n&quot;I'm getting sick of your bullshit.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is that what you tell all the girls?&quot; \u2015Bushmaster and Misty Knight [src]\n\nWhen Cage attacked one of Bushmaster's drug warehouses and threatened to kill Bushmaster if he did not tell him where he was keeping Misty Knight, Bushmaster told him that he did not know what he was talking about and Cage attacked him. Bushmaster ordered his men to shoot Cage while he escaped. The bullets did nothing to Cage as they could not penetrate his skin.\n\nBushmaster visited Pop's Barber Shop and threatened to burn down Pop's Barber Shop and kill everyone inside if he did not get a haircut, including the young girl named Tilda Johnson, who could do a mean cornrows, before he left. Tilda snuck out of the shop and stole Bushmaster's car while he was inside getting a shave. Bushmaster ran outside and found Tilda attempting to get away. He then chased after Tilda in the stolen car.\n\nTilda was able to evade Bushmaster's pursuit until he was able to push her car off the road and caused her car to roll over and crash. Bushmaster dragged Tilda from her car and found out who she was. Tilda, however, was rescued by a bystander who had witnessed the entire incident and called the police. Bushmaster was arrested for kidnapping, but he was released from police custody later.[2]\n\nBusiness Proposition\n\n&quot;Now, we are making money, yes, but not as much as we should. It's a competitive market, man. You're good. And that girl, well, she's something else.

It's time for you to grow up.&quot; \u2015Bushmaster and Shades [src]\n\nBack at Harlem's Paradise, Bushmaster offered Shades a percentage of his drug business, but Shades refused. Bushmaster made an offer to Diamondback to sell him some of his product in exchange for a fee. Bushmaster met with Shades, who berated him for not being a better businessman and selling to Diamondback. Shades told Bushmaster that he was selling drugs on his own, but Bushmaster told him that he had a plan to sell his drugs in Bushmaster branded bullets. Bushmaster then attempted to seduce Shades' wife, Tilda Johnson, but she refused his advances.\n\nThe next day, Bushmaster gave a speech to the patrons of Harlem's Paradise as they celebrated the end of their evening. Bushmaster boasted about his power and demanded that they bow to him, but was met with little response. Shades then insulted Bushmaster, who then drew his gun on Shades. Luke Cage then attacked Bushmaster, but Bushmaster managed to get the upper hand and beat Cage into submission. As Bushmaster prepared to shoot Cage, Tilda Johnson shot Bushmaster in the chest with a concealed gun and stole his gun, with Shades shooting the other members of Bushmaster's entourage before they could react.\n\nBushmaster and his men went into hiding at a warehouse, where Bushmaster furiously scolded Shades for his betrayal. Shades explained that he had been working with Diamondback, but now wanted to make a better life for himself and his wife. Bushmaster, realizing that Shades had a point, agreed to go into hiding for the night. The next day, Bushmaster was visited by Knight, Shades, and Cage. Knight had returned to take back Harlem's Paradise. Knight gave Bushmaster a chance to surrender, but Bushmaster refused and attempted to shoot Knight, but was overpowered by Cage and Knight, forcing him to surrender.\n\nWhile Knight and Cage prepared to transport Bushmaster to Ryker's Island, Bushmaster told them that the shipment of drugs would be arriving that night. The police tried to stop the convoy, but the SWAT team was gunned down by Bushmaster's men. Knight decided to attack the warehouse to stop the shipment from getting to New York. Knight, Cage, and Bushmaster fought his men while Tilda Johnson fought Diamondback and his men, although Diamondback managed to escape from the scene.\n\nOnce Knight and Cage subdued the rest of Bushmaster's men, Knight interrogated Bushmaster about where the shipment was. Bushmaster told them that the guns had already been sold to a man named Ricky. Knight and Cage traveled to a diner to look for Ricky, where they found Ricky talking to his partner Rico. Knight threatened Ricky into giving her the location of the shipment. Once Ricky told Knight the location, she and Cage drove to the location where the guns were being shipped. Knight was able to steal the guns from the men who were shipping them, but one of Bushmaster's men threw a grenade into the truck. Cage managed to catch the grenade and toss it back at Bushmaster's men, but was then hit by the truck, knocking him unconscious. Knight ran Cage to the hospital while Bushmaster's men reclaimed their guns and returned them to Bushmaster.[3]\n\nPersonality\n\nTo be added\n\nAbilities\n\nExpert Combatant : Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.\n\n: Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.

Here's how you can tell them that you're not happy with this proposal, using just your email address.\n\nWho?\n\nIf you're concerned about online porn, you might have already signed a petition on the government's website calling for the default-on filter to be dropped. And in the wake of the controversy around the DEA, you might also have signed a petition demanding that ISPs should automatically block sites known to be involved in the distribution of online child abuse imagery. (Both of those petitions are still open for signatures if you want to join in).\n\nBut now it's time to tell the Government about some of the other things they're doing that are not as sensible, and we'll help you do it.\n\nWhat?\n\nFor a long time now, the UK Government has wanted to bring in a new Digital Economy Act. Last summer, the new law was finally published. The Act is massive, and there's lots to argue with, but it looks like the Government may be preparing to rush it through Parliament without any further debate. That means there's a limited window of opportunity to discuss changes to the draft before it becomes an Act of Parliament, and the Government starts work on enforcing it.\n\nThe draft DEA proposes a number of controversial new laws, including the opt-out default filter that's being discussed so widely. But the Act also proposes lots of other worrying measures, and gives the Government a lot more power to interfere with our online communications. The Act's supporters will tell you that it will help to tackle online infringement, for example. But its many critics argue that it risks stifling innovation in online services, and giving the Government a free hand to censor the internet in other ways.\n\nOn Monday, we told you that you could email your MP to demand a debate on the DEA. Now we've got even more reason to tell the Government that we're not happy with the draft DEA.\n\nThis week, the Pirate Party UK submitted a response to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) on the Digital Economy Act, which responds to the Government's consultation on the proposals. We're not the only ones with concerns about the proposals; the Open Rights Group has submitted its own response (pdf) to the Government's consultation, and Index on Censorship has produced a response (pdf).\n\nHere's why we think the Government's proposals are a Bad Thing:\n\nThe proposals for an &quot;Extended Liability for Platforms&quot; could have serious unintended consequences for small internet service providers and independent content sharing websites, making them responsible for policing their services and preventing copyright infringement. We think this is likely to stifle innovation in new services, and also has serious implications for our online privacy.\n\nThe plans for an automatic filtering system to block content that is not classified by the state could lead to a drastic over-blocking of content. It could block more than just &quot;extreme pornography&quot; - it could block access to anything the Government decides is inappropriate. There's no requirement for these filters to be accurate or transparent, so we won't even be able to tell what's been blocked.\n\nUnder the proposals, the Government would also have the power to block websites that it claims are &quot;blatantly&quot; or &quot;unlawfully&quot; infringing copyright. This could be a serious threat to online innovation, and to our online privacy. And again, there's no requirement for these blocks to be accurate or transparent.\n\nThe DEA would make it much easier for the Government to put in place more blocking orders, and extend their scope. The wording of the legislation is vague enough that it could be used to order ISPs to censor content that isn't even illegal. The Government has already said that it wants to use its new powers to stop us from accessing websites that might be used to share copyrighted material.\n\nThe DEA is the biggest threat to our online privacy since the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act. If the Government gets its way, then they'll have the power to block websites and track what we're doing online. And they'll be able to do it without even telling us that it's happening.\n\nYou can read the Pirate Party's full response to the DEA consultation here (pdf).\n\nNow we need your help\n\nIf you're concerned about the DEA, you can join us in telling the Government what you think about the proposed Act.\n\nThe Open Rights Group's response (pdf) to the DEA consultation is still open for signatures. Once they've got enough names on the petition, they'll send their response to the Government.\n\nAnd now we've got our own response to the Government's consultation on the Digital Economy Act. Please support our campaign to stop the Act by signing our response here (pdf).\n\nWe'll be sending our response to the Government later this week, and we hope that it will give people the opportunity to stop the Act before it's too late.\n\nThis is the one chance we have to stop the DEA.

It\u2019s a policy that seems to favour the government at the expense of foreign interests and brings into question whether or not the government has a commitment to fighting corruption and seeking justice.\n\nThe new policy has been met with much scrutiny both in Zimbabwe and internationally. Many have expressed concern that the implementation of the policy will be flawed and that it will ultimately lead to a worsening of the economic situation in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), has expressed its disapproval of the policy, stating that it will further marginalise Zimbabweans who aren\u2019t involved in the government or who support the opposition.\n\nOn the international level, the Indigenisation policy is one of the latest changes to the Zimbabwean government that have raised concern. Since he took office in November 2017, President Mnangagwa has brought the central bank and the national oil company under government control. This has led to further speculation about the political and economic direction that the government intends to take.\n\nIs the policy legal?\n\nThe Indigenisation policy was initially announced in 2010 and later replaced by another policy called the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim-Asset). The Zim-Asset policy, which was issued in 2013, introduced a set of guidelines for the process of indigenisation. It requires that 51% of all Zimbabwean businesses be transferred to the country\u2019s black majority. However, the policy has never been enforced.\n\nThe decision to revive the policy in 2017 has been widely criticised. Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement urging Mnangagwa to repeal the policy. HRW believes that the policy will only exacerbate the poor economic situation in Zimbabwe. The statement also notes that the government has never properly implemented the policy. It states that \u201cthe fact that no businesses have been indigenized in the past six years suggests that it is unworkable, and that it will not contribute to economic development or job creation.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the African Union, Zimbabwe is bound to uphold the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights, which contains specific provisions regarding the protection of private property.

It was developed by Guerrilla Cambridge (and published by Sony) and released on October 29th, 2016. It takes place in a futuristic sci-fi setting, where you play as one of a number of different characters. Each character uses a different kind of battle suit, allowing them to take part in 3 different sports. Those sports are essentially the 3 main games. They are called RIGS, Megaton, and Gravity Wars. These games play as though they\u2019re real sports. They play more or less how you\u2019d expect them to. You score points by hitting goals, and your objective is to take the ball, and score it in the goal.\n\nThe first game is RIGS, which is essentially a shooting game. There are multiple game modes. Each mode is the same, except you\u2019re playing different characters, and there\u2019s a different goal for you to hit. RIGS is the most fun game in the package, simply because it\u2019s a FPS, which is something you don\u2019t get a lot of in VR games.\n\nMegaton is a sort of bumper-car football game. It\u2019s the second most fun game in the package, just because it\u2019s an interesting spin on something we all know. It is also a lot easier to master than RIGS.\n\nGravity Wars is a very interesting concept, and very hard to master. The game has no physics, and you have to control your direction by using the stick on the right. It\u2019s very challenging, and once you get the hang of it, it can be fun.\n\nRIGS: Mechanized Combat League is a game that is good fun for those who have VR. There\u2019s nothing else like it. It has an interesting concept, and it makes for an interesting single player experience. The multiplayer is there if you want it, but if you don\u2019t, you can use bots, and they will be enough to let you master the game.

It turns out not even close.\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that self-driving technology is more or less as old as the automobile itself. In fact, there are a number of cars on the road today with self-driving features, but they are only meant to assist the driver and not take over completely.\n\nOne such system, called Autopilot, was first launched by Tesla in October 2015. The main feature allows the car to drive itself on a highway, but it\u2019s still supposed to be monitored by the driver.\n\nUnfortunately, Tesla and Elon Musk have become a lightning rod for scrutiny after an accident last week that killed a Model X driver using Autopilot. A series of emails have revealed that Tesla has attempted to make it clear that Autopilot is not a \u201cself-driving\u201d feature.\n\nIn a recent letter to shareholders, Musk wrote, \u201cWhen used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? For one, this was an admission that the technology was not yet ready for public consumption.\n\nTesla is also being called to answer to whether or not the driver should have known that he was using the Autopilot feature. The company says the driver would have known since he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and the car\u2019s steering wheel was not in a locked position.\n\nA photo taken by a witness has been released, showing the driver looking down at something with his hands not on the wheel.\n\nThe automaker has since issued a recall to fix the issue and said it will be updating the Autopilot system to ensure that drivers stay engaged with the vehicle\u2019s operation.\n\nUber said it will be disabling the self-driving feature in its fleet of Volvo XC90s after one of its vehicles ran a red light in San Francisco last week, killing the woman. The car was in self-driving mode and the Uber employee behind the wheel wasn\u2019t able to take control of the vehicle in time.\n\nTesla and Uber are not alone in pursuing self-driving cars. Most automakers have some form of autonomous vehicle in the works, as well as companies like Google and Apple. Tesla is still the only automaker with a Level 5 vehicle that has no steering wheel or pedals, however.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Google\u2019s self-driving cars have only been involved in 11 accidents over the course of 1.5 million miles of driving, but most were caused by human error.\n\nGoogle has said that the biggest hurdle for self-driving cars will be the creation of a trust between car owners and their vehicle. To that end, the company has been testing a number of prototypes over the last several years, which they claim have driven millions of miles without causing any accidents.\n\nVolvo has been developing its own version of an autonomous vehicle for some time now, but the company is not going at it alone. They\u2019ve partnered with Uber, which bought some XC90 vehicles from Volvo, to run a fleet of self-driving Volvos for ride-hailing in Pittsburgh, where Uber\u2019s research center is located.\n\nWith the recent incidents involving Tesla and Uber, the questions of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s safe have only been heightened. Tesla is going to fix the problem with its Autopilot system and Uber is pausing its own self-driving testing, but it\u2019s clear that these vehicles are a long way from being ready for mass adoption.\n\nWill the driverless cars revolution ever happen?

It has however changed the way in which tax relief on contributions to personal pensions is calculated.\n\nThe current situation, whereby the actual value of the tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution, as opposed to the rate of relief, is included in the calculation of income tax, has led to some confusion.\n\nThere is a belief that the relief that is received on the sum of a pension contribution is reduced to 10 per cent and therefore is not as good as the relief received on ISAs, where the actual value of the relief is not included in the calculation of income tax.\n\nThis misunderstanding may well have led to some people contributing to ISAs rather than pensions in order to maximise tax relief.\n\nIn addition, if the actual value of the tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution is used as a deduction from the gross amount of the pension contribution then the level of relief has not changed at all. The actual value of the relief received on the sum of a pension contribution in the income tax calculation has increased in line with the amount of gross income that is subject to tax relief.\n\nFor example, a gross contribution of \xa310,000 would result in an actual tax relief of \xa37,500 under the current arrangements (the gross contribution is grossed up by 50 per cent to give the net pension contribution of \xa37,500).\n\nUnder the new arrangements, the gross contribution would remain at \xa310,000, but the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution would be \xa37,000. The relief on the actual value of the pension contribution is not reduced to 10 per cent.\n\nThe amount of gross income that is subject to tax relief is now \xa340,000. If you earned this amount in income before your pension contributions, then the actual tax relief on the sum of the pension contribution would be \xa330,000, rather than \xa37,500.\n\nWhat has changed is the way in which the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution is calculated. The net pension contribution (the amount actually deducted from the gross income) will no longer be grossed up to produce the actual tax relief received on the sum of the pension contribution.\n\nTherefore, the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution will always be lower than the actual tax relief received on the actual value of a pension contribution.\n\nIt is important to note that it is not the rate of relief that is affected. It is the actual value of the relief that is reduced. The rate of relief is not affected.\n\nPension contributions are still exempt from tax, although the amount of income that is excluded from tax is less than it would have been if the relief was given on the actual value of the pension contribution.\n\nSecondly, the changes to the regulation of pensions and ISAs have not increased the level of tax relief on pensions. The actual level of tax relief on pensions has not changed. The maximum level of tax relief is still 40 per cent.\n\nThe regulation of pensions has changed. Under the new rules, the maximum amount that can be paid into a pension pot, subject to tax relief, is \xa31.8 million. The maximum amount that can be paid into an ISA, subject to tax relief, is \xa37,000.\n\nBoth the maximum contribution level of pensions and ISAs has increased, but the maximum tax relief that can be obtained on both types of products is the same.\n\nIf you have already opened a pension plan, then you can only increase the contribution amount by \xa32,880 per year. Any extra contribution beyond the annual limit will not be eligible for tax relief. The full value of the contribution, regardless of how much it is, will have to be paid from your gross income.\n\nThe actual level of tax relief on ISAs has not changed. The maximum amount of ISA contributions that can be paid into an ISA in any tax year is \xa37,000. This has not changed. Any amount that is paid into an ISA in excess of this amount will not be eligible for tax relief. The full value of the contribution, regardless of how much it is, will have to be paid from your gross income.\n\nSo in summary, the actual level of tax relief on ISAs has not changed. The maximum amount that can be paid into an ISA, subject to tax relief, is \xa37,000.\n\nThe actual]" time="0.350"><properties><property name="score" value="0.2880686" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.2880686&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.2880686

Most of the time the game was played with one of my kids as the banker. The game required a bit of accounting to keep track of all the money. More often than not the game was a heated one and everyone, particularly the banker, enjoyed counting out money while money was being piled up all around the board.\n\nMonopoly is an interesting game for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, it requires the basic accounting function of making change. The cashier has to be able to count out the correct change for all the players. This seems like a very simple, but important function. If a cashier can\u2019t count change, you would have to return the money, and you might not get it back.\n\nAlso, with any money that comes into the game there are some decisions that have to be made. For example, with a loan, how much should be charged to each player. More importantly, how much can the players afford to pay back?\n\nIn addition, how much does the bank loan to the players and what are the terms? What does the bank require to be repaid? At what time? What happens if there is not enough money to pay back the bank?\n\nThis seems like an easy concept, but a lot of my kids had a difficult time trying to figure out what they had to do to get out of debt.\n\nFinally, there are times when players simply get too deep into debt. They are forced to sell off a building, or even the entire game.\n\nThis seems like a pretty simple concept, but I found it interesting because it taught some of my kids a very valuable lesson about life. They realized how important it is to have a budget. More importantly, they realized how much money they had to spend. They had to spend wisely because they couldn\u2019t go into debt.\n\nI think it\u2019s easy to teach kids to balance their checkbook and keep track of their spending, but it\u2019s much more difficult to teach them to spend wisely and stay out of debt.\n\nThe same goes for a family\u2019s bank account. Families, just like the player\u2019s in monopoly, need to keep track of the money coming into the bank account and what is going out. They need to make sure there is enough money to cover the things they need to pay for and that there is enough money to cover the things they want to spend money on. They need to be responsible with their money and realize they can\u2019t go into debt.\n\nThe game of Monopoly teaches a lot of these principles. It is not a game of instant gratification. There are no easy money schemes. It\u2019s a game that will test the mind and the ability to be responsible with money.\n\nIf you have kids, Monopoly is a great way to learn about personal finance. You don\u2019t need to be an expert, but you do need to be willing to show them how to count and account for money.]" time="0.289"><properties><property name="score" value="1.5322425" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 1.5322425&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 1.5322425

Hill didn't have a good game, and the Chiefs were able to put him in his place. Burkhead was also pretty good, and scored the only Bengals touchdown on the day.\n\nBoth running backs ran for over 100 yards, but the key difference was Hill fumbled twice, including once inside the Chiefs' 20.

For the first time in my life I am terrified that what I learned as a child is wrong. There is no more mother or father to turn to. There is no more food to count on. This is my last chance to sound the alarm that we are being systematically robbed and cheated and lied to and I don\u2019t know what we are going to do about it.\n\nA few years ago I could not have imagined that I would find myself writing this. I was born and raised in the village of Old Massett on Haida Gwaii, also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, in Canada. We fish and hunt and gather food and make our own shelter and build our own community. This is how it has been for thousands of years. In modern language this is called subsistence living. We were the last people in Canada to sign treaties with our colonial oppressors in the 1800s. These documents were the foundation of our way of life.\n\nThen it all changed in the early 2000s when the first commercial aquaculture license was issued on our coasts. At first, like most people on Haida Gwaii, I thought that farming fish would provide income for our community. Little did I know that the promise of wealth would come with a heavy price.\n\nThe first evidence I saw that something was wrong was in 2006. The sea lice were everywhere and a fish farm had started using a pesticide called Slice. I saw the sea lice on the fish and sea lions. I saw sea lions coughing up blood, the bones on their backs visible through their skin.\n\nIn 2007, the open net pen at salmon farm salmon feedlots one kilometre off the coast of my village collapsed. An estimated two to three million Atlantic salmon, with a value of $6.5 million to $8 million, swam into the ocean. There was no monitoring, no analysis of the risk to wild salmon, not a word to local communities.\n\nAnd then the toxins appeared. In 2008 and 2009 people in my village became sick and died. In the village of Klemtu next door, children were born with flipper-like hands and feet. In Norway, which had a higher concentration of fish farms, brain tumours and other cancers were rising and women were giving birth to deformed babies.\n\nI looked at these stories and thought, \u201cThis can\u2019t happen to us.\u201d\n\nThis was followed by the closure of the Haida Nation\u2019s only grocery store. People in my village and community started suffering from serious health problems, especially neurological ones. We were told it was due to influenza or SARS. We had no idea that a toxin, which our bodies have not evolved to handle, was being released into the air and our water. The Sea Around Us reported that fish farms were creating the most toxic area in the world, right next to the First Nations in Haida Gwaii. This happened, and no one told us.\n\nI realized I had to do something. For the first time in my life I realized that what my ancestors had always taught me was wrong. It was not nature that took care of us. It was we who were responsible for taking care of nature.\n\nI wrote my first letter to the local newspaper. It was my story, and I was afraid to publish it.\n\n\u201cHow many people have to get sick and die before they take this seriously?\u201d I asked.\n\nWe waited and waited, and nothing happened. I wrote my second letter. Nothing.\n\nWe waited and waited. Still nothing.\n\nPeople in my village got sick and died, and the Norwegian scientists kept warning that their food supply was being contaminated. We were told that this was the price of progress, that it was our job to clean up the mess. And we had to do it on our own.\n\nAnd then the baby seals came. There are no young sea lions, so the seals started eating the herring. At first we thought it was cute. Then we realized they were killing the herring. There were too many seals.\n\nI wrote my third letter. I looked at the numbers and saw that Norway was killing 80,000 seals a year and there were only 80,000 seals left.\n\nI started to organize rallies and a campaign called Save the Herring, which caught the attention of major news outlets across the globe. By this time I had a voice. I was a professor of biology at UBC and one of the world\u2019s experts on fish farming, open net pen fish farms, and marine pollution. I knew the science.\n\n\u201cHow many baby seals have to get cancer before they take this seriously?\u201d I asked.\n\nIn the midst of this, Canada approved a massive new open net pen farm. This was the largest salmon farm in the world. Our local paper warned us that \u201cthe massive farm will increase marine pollution in the area.\u201d This farm started dumping blood and feces into our waters. The evidence was mounting that we were at risk of a catastrophic collapse in our food web.\n\nBut no one cared. The aquaculture industry is worth $400 million a year. We can\u2019t compete with that.\n\nA new form of ocean zoning called an impact assessment was supposed to keep salmon farms out of sensitive areas, but it was all a lie. The people who wrote it are in the industry. They gave themselves exemptions.\n\nThen I realized that I could make a living as a scientist. So I created a lab at the University of Victoria to study the toxins from fish farms. We started to find the pollutants in the mussels and the herring. I published more and more scientific papers.\n\nWe held more rallies, and I wrote more and more letters to the local paper. We were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to the Supreme Court. Our case was thrown out, but the judge was extremely critical of the Canadian government and gave them 18 months to fix their laws. But the government is now granting the aquaculture industry a blanket exemption from environmental laws and protections. The judge told them that they could not do this. But they did.\n\nI have studied toxicology for 30 years and I have never seen this. We know that these toxins are not getting into our environment accidentally. The only reason they are there is because someone put them there. It is like they are trying to poison us.\n\nAnd then we started to see a new toxin. This time it was a by-product of the feed used in the salmon pens.\n\nA Norwegian scientist tested a by-product of salmon feed. The test showed that it was toxic. The Norwegian government stopped using the feed. In 2015, that same scientist tested all the salmon feed used in the British Columbia industry. The results showed that there was another new toxin, this time a carcinogen. The Norwegian scientist said, \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that it could happen at such high levels by chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many toxins have to get into our food before we take this seriously?\u201d I asked.\n\nThis time I knew that there was something wrong with my brain. We found out that Norway and Scotland were using the same feed. We had a toxic lab here in British Columbia, so what about Norway and Scotland? And the feed is approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and used in these salmon farms.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see who we are going to turn to.\n\nThen a woman in Ketch Harbour started asking questions. She wrote to the local paper and was ridiculed and insulted. She wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He never replied.\n\nShe was not from my village. She was a white woman from Newfoundland. Her grandfather was a fisherman.\n\nI wrote to her, and then I realized I could write to everyone. And I did. I started to get hundreds of people to write letters, and we wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and to our Premier, the head of our government. We wrote to every MLA, the Members of the Legislative Assembly, and we were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to court again. This time we were supported by 30 affidavits from fishermen and local citizens.\n\nI went to the hearings. The minister did not even show up.

He is also well known for his attempts to fuse the sciences with theology, something of a controversial topic for medieval theologians. The ontological argument itself is based upon the idea that God\u2019s nature is that of existence. Therefore, to say that God exists is to say that God has the greatest nature, which in turn leads to the conclusion that God must exist. Some scholars argue that this is the proof\u2019s most fundamental flaw, namely that God\u2019s nature is unprovable and thus, cannot be equated to the definition of existence. Other critics point out that the greatest nature is really a metaphysic and therefore cannot be understood by people. The latter claim has been supported by Immanuel Kant and many other philosophers since. Kant\u2019s work was not known to Anselm\u2019s, but it is clear that the German philosopher would not have found much use in Anselm\u2019s philosophy.\n\nThe foundation of Anselm\u2019s ontological argument is a branch of philosophy known as natural theology. Natural theology is the search for a knowledge of God through the use of reason. The argument\u2019s goal is to prove that God exists in some way, and as such is a concept that is widely accepted in the world of Christian philosophy. In many ways, Anselm\u2019s argument for God\u2019s existence shares many similarities with the arguments of many of his contemporaries. Anselm claims that God exists and that this conclusion can be proven using the method of defining terms. The proof proceeds from the claim that God is the greatest thing conceivable to the claim that God must also exist. Anselm\u2019s argument does not satisfy many people because it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that God is in fact the greatest conceivable thing. This is one of the major weaknesses of Anselm\u2019s argument, but it is also one of the weaknesses of most arguments for the existence of God. The ontological argument can be seen as an attempt to prove God\u2019s existence without supporting any specific philosophical view of God\u2019s nature.\n\nMuch of Anselm\u2019s work focuses on the attempts to explain and prove God\u2019s existence. He was one of the earliest of many philosophers to attempt to explain and prove God\u2019s existence. The debate over the existence of God has continued over the years, and the arguments have been supported and refuted on many different occasions. Anselm\u2019s work is important because he was one of the first philosophers to put forth the idea that existence itself was proof of God. He was also one of the first Christian philosophers to try and explain the idea of God in a non-theological way. Many of Anselm\u2019s contemporaries had rejected his view on God\u2019s nature, and they also criticized his work on natural theology.\n\nOne of the major debates over Anselm\u2019s work was that of the ontological argument. This is a popular concept that states that God\u2019s existence is a self-evident truth. The name of the argument comes from the phrase \u201csomething that is greater than which cannot be conceived\u201d. This concept became widely accepted in the world of Christian philosophy, and it is still being debated today. The concept of God\u2019s existence as a self-evident truth has been supported by many Christian philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas\u2019 view of God was one of the most influential views of God\u2019s nature in the Middle Ages. The ideas presented by Anselm and Aquinas on God\u2019s nature were among the first attempts to view God in a logical way.\n\nMost of Anselm\u2019s work focused on the idea of God and the way in which God was perceived. He focused on the idea that God was perceived through faith and that this idea had a real and substantial foundation. Many critics viewed Anselm as a philosophical follower of Augustine, and he was certainly influenced by many of Augustine\u2019s works. The Confessions of Augustine were written in the fifth century, and they discussed the views of the time on God and the manner in which people should understand God. Anselm\u2019s view of God is therefore quite different from many of his contemporaries, and he was heavily criticized for his work on natural theology.\n\nThe ideas presented by Anselm were extremely influential to his contemporaries. Although his ideas were at times criticized, many of his contemporaries found them to be the most logical views of God. His argument for God\u2019s existence was extremely popular among his peers, but it is one of his most controversial works.\n\nAnselm of Canterbury Biography\n\nAnselm of Canterbury was born in 1033 in Aosta. He was the second of four sons and his parents were wealthy. Anselm\u2019s father was an Italian who owned a noble estate. His mother was the niece of the archbishop of Rheims. Anselm was well educated, and he studied both rhetoric and literature as a young man. He studied law in 1057 at the cathedral school in Laon. During this time, he became close friends with Roscelin of Compi\xe8gne. Roscelin was an expert on logic, and he would be one of Anselm\u2019s best friends and mentors for the rest of his life. He was also close to Lanfranc and eventually became his student.\n\nAnselm studied theology in the early 1060s at the cathedral school of Chartres. He also spent a great deal of time studying theology and grammar at the school of Benevento. Anselm spent two years at the school and was then called to the cathedral school of Canterbury in 1062. Anselm was called to the cathedral school to replace the archbishop. The archbishop of Canterbury was the highest ranking prelate in England and he was charged with the administration of the Church in England. Anselm quickly gained respect in his new position, and he wrote a new rule for the cathedral school. The rule was based on the Rule of St. Benedict, which was the most important rule for monasteries at the time. He was also responsible for the cathedral school\u2019s many other duties and its administration. He established the system of electing canons and was also in charge of its finances. Anselm had a great deal of power in his new position, but he also was a reformer. He placed emphasis on the importance of education and scholarship, and he ensured that the students received high quality instruction. The rule at the cathedral school was seen as being high quality and the students at the school were trained in Greek, Latin, rhetoric, dialectic, and arithmetic.\n\nAnselm also established a library at the school. The library contained many ancient works, which were frequently read by students. He became an expert on the writings of Augustine, and he began his own writing career in the early 1060s. His writings were influential in the development of later philosophy, and his ideas on natural theology were both influential and controversial. In 1063, Anselm was appointed archbishop of Canterbury. This was an extremely important position, and Anselm would play a major role in the Christianization of England. He was a major contributor to the revival of learning in England, and he attempted to bring education to all of his subjects.\n\nHe was a skilled theologian, and he produced several important theological works. These included the Monologion and the Proslogion. The Monologion addressed the questions of the nature of God. The Proslogion addressed the questions of the nature of God\u2019s knowledge and the proof for God\u2019s existence. Anselm was influenced by Augustine in his writing of the Monologion]" time="0.580"><properties><property name="score" value="0.22423856749999999" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[In California, a convicted pedophile is on the loose.

On February 25 1915 the first ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, a total of 11,000. The rest of the 20,000 strong force arrived over the following weeks.\n\nMany of the ANZAC troops had volunteered at the outbreak of war, lured by the romantic and patriotic view of warfare and by a yearning for adventure.\n\nJust as the troops were largely made up of volunteers, the casualties at Gallipoli were also predominantly made up of volunteers.\n\nIt has been estimated that 10 percent of all the Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli were killed during the campaign.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies commented that \u201cthe experience of war for Australians would always be Gallipoli\u201d.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the ANZAC troops, the British had launched an attack on the Gallipoli peninsula on the 25th of April 1915.\n\nThe Allied attack consisted of five divisions, with most of the troops coming from the British Army. It was hoped that the landings would help the British Navy to get through the Dardanelles, a narrow strip of water separating the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara, which leads to the Bosphorus and the Black Sea.\n\nHowever, the initial landings met with great opposition from the Turkish defenders, and the Allied forces soon became pinned down on the beaches and unable to advance.\n\nThe ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, the capital of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s European territories, just over a month later on the 19th of May 1915.\n\nThe ANZACs had initially been part of the British and French force in Egypt. They were moved to a separate command under General Ian Hamilton, with Australian General William Birdwood as his deputy.\n\nA General Order issued on the 3rd of May stated that the Australian and New Zealand troops were to be given \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d duties from those of the British.\n\nThis was not intended to be interpreted as any form of segregation. Rather, it was due to the fact that the Australians and New Zealanders, despite being part of the British Empire, were soldiers who had volunteered from their own country, and who had formed a unique sense of national identity and pride.\n\nIn order to maintain a clear distinction between the Allied forces and the enemy, the ANZACs also adopted their own distinctive insignia, such as a yellow or red poppy on their badges and hats.\n\nHowever, despite the greater efforts to set the ANZACs apart from their Allied allies, the treatment of the soldiers at Gallipoli was the same as that received by the British.\n\nThe ANZACs were given responsibility for the defence of the Anzac Cove, at the northernmost tip of the Gallipoli Peninsula.\n\nThe cove was strategically important to the Turks because of its proximity to the Narrows, the strip of water which separated the peninsula from the Dardanelles.\n\nThe Anzacs were also expected to hold on to the various hills and ridges along the peninsula, despite the fact that the Allied positions were in constant danger of being shelled]" time="0.307"><properties><property name="score" value="0.006048653" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00604865&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00604865

The Object class is an abstract class and doesn't have a constructor. If you don't have any idea what I'm talking about here, don't worry about it for now. I'll explain it in detail in Chapter 5. You can't instantiate an object from the Object class, so the only real purpose of the Object class is to serve as a base class for other classes. You can think of the Object class as being like a template that all other classes derive from. If you want to learn more about how classes work and how you can customize Excel's classes to create your own customized classes, check out my Microsoft Press book Microsoft Excel VBA and Macros (ISBN 0-7356-1845-0).\n\nWhen you create a class module in your Excel application, you must specify the class name as a string literal. For example, if you create a class module called Class1, Excel uses the following syntax in the declarations area of the class module to specify the name of the class:\n\nPublic Class Class1 End Class\n\nAs with any other module in Excel, a class module doesn't do anything until you create an object from the class module. Creating an object is a two-step process: You first instantiate the object, and then you call the methods and properties of the object. For example, to create an object from the class named Class1, you use the following code:\n\nDim obj1 As New Class1\n\nOnce you create an instance of the object, you can call the methods and properties of the object by preceding the method or property name with the name of the object. For example, if you created an instance of the class named Class1, you would use the following code to call the method named Display:\n\nobj1.Display\n\nIf the object contains an object variable that represents another object of the same class, you can also call the methods of that object. For example, if the object named obj1 created in the preceding code contained an object variable named obj2 that represented another object of the same class, you would use the following code to call the Display method of the object named obj2:\n\nobj1.obj2.Display\n\nThe property and method names of a class are preceded by the name of the class, as shown in the preceding examples.\n\nIf you create a class module that contains a custom collection object, such as a collection of cells in a worksheet, you must use a new operator to create the collection object. For example, the following statement creates a collection object named myCol1 that is a collection of worksheet cells:\n\nDim myCol1 As New Collection\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you specify the type of object that the collection can contain when you define the type of the collection.\n\nFor example, the following statement creates a collection object that can contain only the cells in a worksheet:\n\nDim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range)\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you can add items to the collection object by using the Add method of the collection object.\n\nFor example, the following statement adds a range named &quot;Region&quot; to the collection object named myCol1:\n\nmyCol1.Add mySheet.Range(&quot;Region&quot;)\n\nThe Add method takes two arguments:\n\n\u25a0 The object that you want to add to the collection object\n\n\u25a0 The collection that you want to add the object to\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you can add an object to a collection object that is an instance of a different class, but the type of the objects in the collection must be the same.\n\nThe following code example adds the range named &quot;Region&quot; to the collection object named myCol1. This code example assumes that you've created the objects in the declaration section of the class module.\n\nSub AddObjectToCollection() Dim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range) Dim myRow As Long, myColumn As Long Dim strName As String ' Obtain a reference to the collection ' that contains the first worksheet in ' the active workbook. Set myCol1 = Sheets(1).Range(1, 1). _ SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible) ' Initialize the name of the cell ' to the value of the Name property. strName = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Value ' Determine the address of the cell ' and store it in the myRow and myColumn ' variables. myRow = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Address myColumn = myCol1.Cell(1, 2).Address ' Create a new Range object. Set myRange = Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;). _ Range(&quot;Region&quot;) ' Add the new range to the collection. myCol1.Add myRange End Sub\n\nThe following code example calls the AddObjectToCollection method to add the range named &quot;Region&quot; to the collection object named myCol1. This code example assumes that you've created the objects in the declaration section of the class module.\n\nSub AddObjectToCollectionWithMethodCall() Dim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range) Dim myRow As Long, myColumn As Long Dim strName As String ' Obtain a reference to the collection ' that contains the first worksheet in ' the active workbook. Set myCol1 = Sheets(1).Range(1, 1). _ SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible) ' Initialize the name of the cell ' to the value of the Name property. strName = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Value ' Determine the address of the cell ' and store it in the myRow and myColumn ' variables. myRow = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Address myColumn = myCol1.Cell(1, 2).Address ' Create a new Range object. Set myRange = Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;). _ Range(&quot;Region&quot;) ' Add the new range to the collection. myCol1.AddObject myRange ' Add another range to the collection ' and display the number of elements in the collection. myCol1.Add myRange MsgBox myCol1.Count End Sub\n\nThe final statement in the AddObjectToCollectionWithMethodCall subroutine is a good example of how you can use a method that belongs to a class to call the methods of the collection object.\n\n0 0]" time="0.712"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0154751043" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Many people who oppose the minimum wage assume that raising the minimum wage is bad for the economy and will cause a lot of unemployment. This is mostly false. A new study has revealed that raising the minimum wage does not kill jobs. This is not just good news for the people who will now get a raise, but also for the economy as a whole.\n\nOpponents of the minimum wage often say that it will create a lot of unemployment and that this is proof that the minimum wage should be abolished. They argue that it creates a job loss on an economy-wide scale. However, this new study has proved that the minimum wage will not cause massive job loss. This is not just great news for the people who get a raise, but it also means that the economy will benefit.\n\nThe study comes from the National Employment Law Project (NELP) and reveals that raising the minimum wage does not cause massive job loss. In fact, only two percent of the workforce is impacted by a minimum wage increase. This means that the economy will benefit, but not that much. However, it is still a positive impact.\n\nHowever, the study also shows that the country would have to raise the minimum wage by $2.13 to achieve the same number of jobs as a similar increase in the 1990s. This is not really a surprise, as the economy was growing more rapidly back then.\n\nRaising the minimum wage was also seen to boost the economy. The study found that a $1 increase in the minimum wage would increase the GDP by $2.62. This is a significant amount and would be great for the economy as a whole. In fact, it could even boost the economy so much that it could lift more people out of poverty.\n\nWhile a raise in the minimum wage does not have a massive impact on the economy as a whole, it still has a positive impact. This means that the people who will now get a raise will enjoy it. This will also help the economy, and make the country a better place to live in.\n\nThose who oppose the minimum wage should know that it does not create massive unemployment. This is also great news for the economy, and it means that raising the minimum wage is great for everyone.]" time="0.364"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0014465919" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[READ MORE Wall Street: Online poker rooms are fading, but who is 6/10/2018 \xb7 As online poker room software and banking options face an uncertain future in the U.S., many of the sites that are still online are trying to\n\nREAD MORE Exclusive: Where do U.S. poker players play online poker 7/10/2018 \xb7 With the April 15th deadline for Nevada-based online poker rooms to stop offering real-money games, where will the displaced players go next?\n\nREAD MORE Online poker room ratings, reviews, and deals - Poker In the wake of Black Friday, you can\u2019t walk three feet in a Las Vegas casino without bumping into someone who\u2019s looking for a blackjack\n\nREAD MORE Nevada Online Poker Rooms On Verge Of Exiting Market Online poker rooms in the United States are in a precarious position right now.

He previously played in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Colorado Avalanche, Ottawa Senators, and Florida Panthers.\n\nHa\u0161ek spent the 1996\u201397 season with HC Pardubice's junior team, and then joined the Czech Extraliga club HC Vset\xedn, appearing in 29 games. Ha\u0161ek was a member of the Czech Republic national under-18 team at the 1997 European Junior Championships, playing in two games and posting a 1.51 GAA.\n\nThe next season, Ha\u0161ek joined HC Pardubice, which was then playing in the Czech 1. Liga. Ha\u0161ek played well for the team, and was chosen by the Colorado Avalanche in the sixth round, 162nd overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He remained with HC Pardubice, and in his final season with the club, he posted a 2.30 GAA in 37 games. Ha\u0161ek was signed by the Avalanche, and on March 9, 2000, he made his NHL debut, against the Detroit Red Wings. He played two more games for the Avalanche before returning to the Czech Republic to join HC Pardubice for the 2000\u201301 season.\n\nHa\u0161ek played in 11 games for the Avalanche the next season, but spent the majority of the 2001\u201302 season with the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, where he posted a 2.20 GAA in 44 games. He remained in North America the next season, playing five games for Colorado and 59 for Hershey, and was then traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for a sixth-round pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft on March 10, 2003. Ha\u0161ek played well for the Blackhawks in 2003\u201304, with a 2.11 GAA in 37 games.\n\nThe next season, Ha\u0161ek played well for the Blackhawks, with a 2.22 GAA in 36 games. However, he was unable to maintain his form, and was replaced as Chicago's starting goaltender by Nikolai Khabibulin, who had been acquired by the Blackhawks in a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Ha\u0161ek was then traded to the Ottawa Senators on March 9, 2005, for a second-round draft pick in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nIn his first season with the Senators, Ha\u0161ek played in 40 games, and posted a 2.26 GAA. He then missed the majority of the 2005\u201306 season after suffering a shoulder injury. He appeared in just five games for the Senators, and was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for Patrick Eaves, a second-round draft pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, and a third-round pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft on September 25, 2005.\n\nHa\u0161ek quickly returned to form with the Avalanche, playing in 54 games and posting a 2.22 GAA. In 2006\u201307, he played in 57 games, and posted a 2.30 GAA. Ha\u0161ek was an important factor in the Avalanche's playoff run, as he posted a 1.65 GAA in eight games.\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Ha\u0161ek signed a two-year contract extension with the Avalanche. The following season, he played in just 35 games due to a groin injury, and his GAA rose to 2.88. He was then sidelined for the rest of the season after having shoulder surgery.\n\nOn June 30, 2009, Ha\u0161ek signed a two-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. He recorded the first win of his Red Wings career on January 2, 2010, in a 3\u20131 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nOn January 1, 2011, Ha\u0161ek was named the First Star of the Week for the week ending December 26. Ha\u0161ek compiled a 3\u20130\u20130 record, a 0.67 goals-against average and a .984 save percentage. He led the Red Wings to their fifth four-game winning streak of the season. During the streak, Ha\u0161ek stopped 135 of 138 shots and yielded only one goal in a span of 140 minutes and four seconds.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, Ha\u0161ek was selected as the NHL's Third Star of the Week. He went 2\u20130\u20131 in three appearances, with both victories coming against Central Division rivals (January 14, 3\u20130 win at Chicago and January 16, 4\u20131 win at St. Louis), and recorded a 1.00 goals-against average and a .962 save percentage.\n\nHa\u0161ek finished the 2010\u201311 season with a career-high 41 victories, just one win behind league leader Martin Brodeur.\n\nOn March 29, 2011, Ha\u0161ek scored a goal against the Los Angeles Kings. The goal, a result of a breakaway due to an errant pass by Kings defenseman Slava Voynov, was the second of Ha\u0161ek's career. His first goal was scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2008. The goal also made him the oldest goaltender in NHL history to score a goal in a game. The record was previously held by Tommy Salo, who scored a goal in a game at the age of 35.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Ha\u0161ek underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder.\n\nHa\u0161ek was injured during the 2011\u201312 preseason, and on October 2, 2011, was placed on long-term injured reserve by the Red Wings. He returned from his injury to back up Ty Conklin for a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on November 29, 2011.\n\nOn July 5, 2012, Ha\u0161ek signed a one-year, $2.05 million contract with the Florida Panthers. He was named the starting goaltender in the Panthers' inaugural game in the 2012\u201313 season against the New Jersey Devils. He was subsequently pulled in the first period after allowing 4 goals on 15 shots. He was replaced by Scott Clemmensen, and on January 24, 2013, Clemmensen was named as the Panthers' starting goaltender for the remainder of the season.\n\nHa\u0161ek was placed on waivers by the Panthers on June 13, 2013. Ha\u0161ek was then bought out from the final year of his contract on June 15, 2013. He was then signed by the Detroit Red Wings for the 2013\u201314 season to backup starter Jimmy Howard.\n\nHa\u0161ek became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, and on September 11, 2014, signed his first contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga. After one season in Pardubice, Ha\u0161ek opted to continue in the Extraliga, signing a two-year deal with HC V\xedtkovice. In his second season with V\xedtkovice, Ha\u0161ek helped his club claim its first league title since 1999, appearing in 15 playoff games. He left as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with HC Pardubice on June 19, 2017.\n\nHa\u0161ek played for the Czech Republic at the 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 World Championships, winning bronze in 2004 and 2005. Ha\u0161ek was the starting goaltender for the Czech Republic team that won the gold medal at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nIn 2003, Ha\u0161ek became a Canadian citizen, but had already represented the Czech Republic in international competition, and he was therefore eligible to play for either national team. On November 7, 2005, he announced that he would continue to represent the Czech Republic, even though he had been approached by the Canadian team and was eligible to play for Canada. Ha\u0161ek's younger brother Ond\u0159ej also plays professional hockey.\n]" time="0.621"><properties><property name="score" value="0.31033863" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Bitcoins are widely considered a great way to make purchases, but it is much harder to pay someone with them. That is exactly the case with Andreas Antonopoulos. He has reportedly been bombarded with requests from individuals who want to make donations to his projects. But he has no means of receiving them.\n\nIs Andreas Antonopoulos Being Misled?\n\nMost people know Andreas Antonopoulos by now. He is one of the most popular and prolific figures in the Bitcoin world. However, the widespread adoption of Bitcoin has led to a lot of new users, many of whom do not have a great understanding of the technology. That is not necessarily a bad thing, though.\n\nIt now appears as if a lot of people think Andreas Antonopoulos accepts donations, whereas he doesn\u2019t. As such, people keep bombarding the Bitcoin community icon with messages asking how they can make a donation. This leads to quite a few jokes being made about it on social media. However, Andreas Antonopoulos is well aware of the situation, as he keeps getting the same questions.\n\nHowever, the most intriguing part of this situation is how Andreas Antonopoulos makes it clear he doesn\u2019t accept donations. For some reason, some people continue to pester him about it. Some individuals even claim they are only able to donate a small amount of money, which would make no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe Andreas Antonopoulos Donation Account\n\nInterestingly enough, Andreas Antonopoulos is quite open about Bitcoin donations, but only to the extent of signing them over to projects. That is not what most people would expect, but it makes a lot of sense to give this money to a good cause. For example, Antonopoulos has donated over US$5,000 worth of Bitcoin to help rebuild the war-torn Marawi in the Philippines. It is evident this money came from donations he received, which is a very interesting development.\n\nThat being said, donations can still be made to Andreas Antonopoulos, even though it is done in a different way. Instead of sending money to his personal wallet, a public Bitcoin wallet has been created for donations to be sent to. That wallet has been active for some time now, and users can send money to a wide range of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash wallets.\n\nDo you think donations should be sent to Andreas Antonopoulos?

In 1831, a convict ship called the \u201cDuke of Wellington\u201d (there are other tales about the origins of the name) ran aground here and was eventually abandoned. The women were moved to Fremantle Prison. The wreck is still there, but it is being eaten by the sea. You can walk to it on a path from Waterhouse Beach. The best way to see the island is by bike, though, because it is so small and flat. The bikes are provided by a company called Island Experience Rottnest. This is a great way to see the island. It costs around $25, which gets you a bike and the unlimited use of it for three hours. They give you a map and instructions, but you can see the whole island by walking in about an hour.\n\nThere are very few buildings here, but what there are have a very interesting history. For example, there is the Weeroona Hotel, the oldest operating hotel in the state. It is run by a company that is owned by the island\u2019s inhabitants. The oldest building is called the Round House. It was built in 1833 and has been restored to the 1830s period. It used to be the men\u2019s quarters. There is also a small cathedral that was built in 1901, and is called St Mary\u2019s Cathedral. There is also a cricket ground here that was originally established in the 1840s. This island was once the penal colony. The ruins of two of the prisons, the Governor\u2019s residence and the convicts\u2019 huts can be seen. They are located at a place called Settlement.\n\nCamel Rock\n\nThis is the most important landmark of the island. It is visible for many miles, and is sometimes mistaken for a camel. The sandstone is interesting, as it was formed from quartzite, which is a very hard stone. Some of the grains have been turned to iron oxide, which is a reddish brown. This was done by chemical reactions that were the result of oxygen and iron.\n\nSome rock formations can also be seen at the Quobba station, which is a restored 19th century railway station. There are a few lookouts here, but the best is at Arch Rock, which is a short distance from the main road. There are about 200 species of birds here, and there is a sanctuary that is managed by a conservation group called the Rottnest Island Conservation Society. This is home to the Tawny Frogmouth, the Black-breasted Button-quail, the Malleefowl, and the Rottnest Island White-tailed Black-Cockatoo.\n\nThere is also an Interpretive Centre that explains the history of the island and its different birds. Another reason to visit this island is the fact that the Aboriginal people, the Wadjuk, were here first. There is an Aboriginal reserve that is in the northern area of the island, and there is also a sacred site that can be seen there. The site is called Yanjul, which means \u201cman with spear\u201d. The local Aboriginals still refer to the island as Wadjemup, which means \u201cIsland of Peace\u201d. The First Fleet stopped at this island, and as such it is the only island in the world where two different nations fought for control.\n\nPlaces to Stay\n\nThere are a few different places to stay on this island.

It was one of the books that inspired me to get into fantasy fiction. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien, was a legend in the world of fantasy fiction, and it was considered one of his greatest works.\n\nAt the time, I hadn't heard of this series. If I had, I probably would have thought &quot;Ew, it's another fantasy book.&quot; It would take me several years to learn that it's not another fantasy book. This is the one that started it all.\n\nThe story was great, and I really liked how Tolkien put all his imagination into it, and wrote a story that was unique and innovative. The story itself was fascinating. I loved the idea of Hobbits, which are little people that lived in an idyllic area, with their own language and customs. This book had a dark side, and even the humor in it was dark. There was a lot of death, evil, and destruction in the book. That's something that stuck with me, even though I really didn't appreciate it at the time.

Jerry Brown\u2019s pen, California became the largest state to legalize marijuana for recreational use and the sixth in the nation to make cannabis available to the general public. Yet, the history of cannabis in California has been a long one \u2014 and not without its rocky moments.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s medical marijuana laws were first approved by voters in 1996 and ushered in a sea change in cannabis culture and use. Yet even in the heyday of Proposition 215, there were raids on medical dispensaries, law enforcement shutting down shops for violation of local zoning codes and municipal zoning laws, local municipalities levying taxes on dispensaries and even offering up community space in which to open shops.\n\nThe result of these early legislative setbacks? The displacement of a long-established network of dispensaries and cultivators. Those who could no longer get by in the state moved to Oregon, Washington, Colorado and other legal states \u2014 essentially exporting the cannabis culture they had created. Now, a new generation of cultivators and distributors are starting businesses in California, with new methods and processes that are a result of the new cannabis industry.\n\nEven as recreational marijuana use became legal in California in January 2018, there has been an uptick in raids of these newly legal businesses, which remains illegal under federal law. In the first week of 2018, there were a reported 26 raids of legal dispensaries in the Bay Area, with 25 arrests and the seizure of $16,000 in cash and seven pounds of cannabis.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement is going to go after illegal operations in any case,\u201d said Sean Donahoe, executive director of the California Cannabis Industry Association. \u201cThese folks who are doing illegal activities, that\u2019s something they have been doing all along.\u201d\n\nIn California, the rules on commercial cannabis businesses are numerous and complex, he said. The fact that a business may be operating legally, that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t being targeted for a raid, according to Donahoe.

      + Human</failure></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[To be blunt, the video you linked to does not really prove anything one way or the other. That video is trying to make it seem like some statements made by Dan Abnett about the use of the term &quot;boy&quot; or &quot;son&quot; when applied to the Raven Guard during the Horus Heresy was a form of apologism for using &quot;boyz&quot; when referring to Orks. This is not the case. While it is true that Abnett's statements were inappropriate, the content of that video fails to really show it. For example, where the video claims that Abnett said &quot;Raven Guard don't ever call themselves boys&quot;, Abnett was in fact saying that Raven Guard did not ever call themselves &quot;boyz&quot; or any other similar slang. He specifically mentioned &quot;boyz&quot; in the context of Orks as an example, and it is the video that is now misrepresenting his words. In other words, Abnett's statements on the subject of Orks are accurate, and the video's attempt to show him in a negative light is based on a misrepresentation.\n\nAdditionally, your claim that the Imperium is &quot;far from perfect&quot; is not true, as the Imperium's culture is based around the worship of the Emperor, who has deified himself and is often referred to as a god by Imperial citizens. This means that the Imperium has absolutely no separation between religion and government, which means that your claim that the Imperium is &quot;far from perfect&quot; is also a form of apologism, as it is ignoring a key element of the Imperium that should be readily apparent to any Imperial citizen. The use of &quot;Apologetic&quot; is a misuse of the word and also misrepresents what the author is trying to say, as you have misrepresented the claim he is making.\n\nThe author's second &quot;claim&quot; is incorrect on many levels, and is also based on a misrepresentation of facts. Firstly, let's take a look at the quote he links to:\n\n&quot;If we wanted to do a straight-up Space Marines game, we would have done Space Marines, right? They\u2019re the coolest guys.&quot;\n\nThis quote is taken out of context. The quote actually goes on to explain why they chose to do the Space Marines as they did. In fact, the quote was in response to a question about why they decided to make Space Marines so &quot;stereotypically heroic&quot; in terms of a tone. The statement that follows in the quote states that it is because Space Marines are the &quot;coolest guys&quot; in the galaxy. What the author is doing here is taking a single quote and presenting it as if it is the entirety of the explanation of why Space Marines are the way they are in this game, when that is not the case.\n\nThe author's next claim is that he does not agree with the statement about the inclusion of certain races, but instead of explaining why he disagrees, he simply says that it is &quot;wrong&quot;. This does not actually prove that the statement is incorrect, and is a form of dog-whistle politics, as it is deliberately vague and meant to be interpreted as &quot;political correctness&quot; or &quot;SJW&quot; or &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; and similar things, all of which are highly charged words. He could very easily have explained why he disagrees with the statement, but he did not. Instead, he chose to attempt to shut down any further discussion of the topic with a rather obscure quote, while also using a misrepresentation of the quote to try and do so.\n\nThe author's final claim is based on another misrepresentation of the source material. In his article, the author linked to an article that states that the developers actually took fan-feedback into account when designing the Space Marine Chapters. In fact, the developers mentioned that they were &quot;watching&quot; the fans' reactions to the game, and were taking note of how the game was received and what fans' concerns were, which is in line with what the developers have said about their reasons for making the Space Marine Chapters they did.\n\nOnce again, the author is trying to use his article as a form of dog-whistle politics, as he is taking these claims and trying to make it seem as if the developers were lying. However, even if the developers were lying about this, which they are not, that does not invalidate the author's argument. In other words, the author's claims that the developers are lying about this are irrelevant to the argument the author is making, and should not be considered when assessing the validity of his arguments.\n\nIn the author's first sentence, he claims that it is &quot;common knowledge&quot; that the Imperium of Man is based on Nazi Germany. However, I do not believe that this is actually true, as I have never heard this before, and the idea seems rather outlandish. In fact, the idea that the Imperium of Man is based on Nazi Germany is so outlandish that it makes me question the author's sanity. Furthermore, his claim is an appeal to emotion, as the author does not really explain why he thinks this, and instead simply uses an emotionally charged accusation.\n\nIn the author's second sentence, he claims that the Space Marine Chapters, as well as the Emperor, are based on &quot;fascist leadership&quot;. I have already addressed the author's claim about the Space Marine Chapters, and I will now address his claim about the Emperor. While I cannot speak for the Emperor's actual policies, he is still worshiped as a god by most of the citizens of the Imperium, which does not actually fit with the definition of &quot;fascist leadership&quot;. Furthermore, the author does not really explain how he came to the conclusion that the Emperor is based on fascist leadership, and instead simply asserts it without any real explanation.\n\nThe author's third claim is based on a misrepresentation of facts, and is yet another form of dog-whistle politics. His claim that a representation of the logo of the White Legion is on the flag of the Imperium is a misrepresentation of the source material. In the source material, it is explicitly stated that the White Legion and the Imperial flag are two separate things, with the author's claim making it seem as if the White Legion is the official flag of the Imperium of Man. This is, of course, untrue. In fact, the White Legion is not even in the same star system as the Imperium, so the White Legion's flag is actually irrelevant to the argument that the author is making.\n\nThe author's fourth claim is also based on a misrepresentation of facts, as well as yet another form of dog-whistle politics. The author claims that the developers stated that the Imperium is &quot;an alliance between Humans and aliens&quot;. While I cannot speak for what the developers actually stated, I can point out that they did not state that the Imperium was an alliance between Humans and aliens. The author's statement that this claim is &quot;common knowledge&quot; is false. In fact, if this was common knowledge, then the author would not have needed to claim that this was what the developers had said. Instead, he would have just cited the developers as having said it. In other words, his claim that this is &quot;common knowledge&quot; is also a form of dog-whistle politics, as it is a claim that is designed to be interpreted as &quot;political correctness&quot; or &quot;SJW&quot; or &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; and similar things, all of which are highly charged words.\n\nIn the author's final claim, he says that the Orks are portrayed as a generic enemy of the Imperium, when in fact they are a threat to the Imperium. The author claims that &quot;Boyz&quot; is used as an insult by the Imperium, when in fact it is used to refer to any Ork. In other words, his claim that the Imperium is &quot;far from perfect&quot; is incorrect, and in fact is a form of dog-whistle politics.]" time="0.588"><properties><property name="score" value="0.00707266875" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[The general consensus in psychology is that intelligence is a singular entity that can be measured and is unchangeable, and that any issues with intelligence will remain constant throughout a person\u2019s life.\n\n\n\nIn general, the accepted view of intelligence is based on a series of experiments carried out in the 1940s and 50s, commonly referred to as the IQ tests. These intelligence tests measured intelligence by identifying patterns and memory, and tested mental agility. But the modern view of intelligence is much broader, and focuses on a person\u2019s ability to learn and their capacity to understand their environment.\n\n\n\nResearch carried out by a group of psychologists in New York have challenged the accepted view, and shown that people\u2019s IQ levels do not necessarily remain the same throughout their lives.\n\n\n\nThey found that if a person has an early traumatic experience, then the level of intelligence is likely to reduce significantly.\n\nThe study\n\nThe study used a database of IQ scores for each person, which was then divided into three groups: people who were not exposed to early trauma, people who had experienced trauma before they were 18 and people who had experienced trauma before they were 16.\n\n\n\nThe study then looked at how the group with early trauma had scored after 16 years.

He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. The striving to free oneself from this delusion is the one issue of true religion. Not to nourish the delusion but to try to overcome it is the way to reach the attainable measure of peace of mind.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1938)\n\nWho would have thought that the the famous scientist, whose ideas took a leap of imagination that seemed to defy common sense, had so much wisdom to share.\n\nEinstein's wisdom, delivered in a simple, direct manner, is of a philosophical nature. And yet, as we have seen, his wisdom is based on a scientific perspective, not a philosophical one. It is a perspective that, as we shall see, stands in contrast to the beliefs of the average person.\n\nThe ultimate source of Einstein's wisdom is his sense of awe. He speaks of being in awe of what he observed in nature, as if these observations of nature had moved him to the core of his being. But this awe was not the end of the matter for Einstein. He does not speak of being in awe and then simply stop and say: &quot;What a wondrous world it is.&quot; Rather, he looks to this sense of awe as a source of inspiration to do more.\n\nEinstein's wisdom is the result of a personal approach to understanding and the sense of awe that this approach has produced. It is, therefore, both a personal and a shared source of wisdom. The person sharing this wisdom is not speaking on behalf of some outside authority, like a philosopher or a scientist. His wisdom is simply the result of a personal quest, not a more generalized, impersonal, public investigation.\n\nEinstein did not discover his wisdom by himself. He spoke about his awe at the &quot;dignity&quot; of nature, by which he meant that the world of nature is majestic, not cheap. Einstein was aware of the sense of awe that his discoveries had evoked in him and he wished to share this feeling with others. In this way, Einstein's wisdom was, at its roots, a shared resource, because the more people who can feel and express awe at the majesty of nature, the better it is for all of us.\n\nIt is as though Einstein had an innate wisdom that he wished to share with others, and as though he felt compelled to do so. Einstein's quest for wisdom was not an abstract exercise in which he wished to understand nature or the meaning of life. Rather, Einstein was driven by a need to share his insights. As the physicist Stephen Hawking has pointed out, the very nature of the scientific enterprise is a social activity, and this is as true of Einstein as it is of Hawking himself.\n\nLike Hawking, Einstein had the good fortune of being born into a social context that could support his quest for wisdom. He lived in an environment in which he was exposed to an intellectual culture that had been nourished by many philosophers who were also his contemporaries. He could, therefore, both draw from the wisdom of his predecessors and challenge them by articulating the insights that he had achieved.\n\nIn addition, the new physics that he helped to develop has spawned many technologies that have radically transformed our understanding of the world and has introduced new scientific disciplines, such as quantum physics, that have enriched our understanding of nature. Our scientific knowledge has become a shared resource that can be used as a basis for developing a new kind of wisdom, one that does not exist in the history of human thought before the twentieth century.\n\nAs we can see, the search for wisdom and the sharing of wisdom are based on a wide array of factors. To create a context that will allow for the growth of a new kind of wisdom, one that can benefit the common good of humanity, it is necessary to invest in science and in a new philosophical perspective.\n\nIn other words, a new kind of wisdom can only arise as the result of a new synthesis, one that links scientific knowledge with a philosophical perspective. It is this new synthesis that will be explored in the final chapter of this book.]" time="0.433"><properties><property name="score" value="0.3897342" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.3897342&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.3897342

It\u2019s why he never had a detailed health care plan. He wanted to talk to people who agreed with him about how terrible Obamacare was.\n\nHe\u2019s never really been interested in a detailed plan. He\u2019s interested in getting media coverage, because he knows the media will talk about what he says.\n\nTrump is constantly in search of free media coverage.

You understand? It was like I was in the Bible.\u201d\n\nSmith is a committed Christian. In 2007, when he was named the most bankable star in Hollywood, Smith made the bold claim that he\u2019s the only top-grossing actor who is a professed Christian. At the time, a study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that just 18 percent of Americans consider Hollywood stars to be good role models, and just 10 percent said the same for politicians. \u201cIf the group that you are the leader of is viewed that way, you have to examine what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Smith said.\n\nOn this day, Smith was concerned about children around the world who are not receiving the care they need to survive. As he read about the dire need for vaccines, Smith thought about his own two kids, and how helpless he would feel if they were sick and dying. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what that must be like. So for me, the easiest thing to do is to support UNICEF. Because when my children get sick, it\u2019s my job to get them help, and if they die, they die. I\u2019m not gonna stop that. I\u2019m not God. But when children around the world get sick and die, it\u2019s God\u2019s responsibility.

Every dollar invested in immunization results in $44 saved in treatment. UNICEF reaches children in 190 countries and territories. Each year, with the help of its many partners, UNICEF supplies more than 50 million children under the age of five with immunizations against the six life-threatening diseases: pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhea, polio, measles, and tetanus. UNICEF also supports the vaccination of pregnant women in countries where the practice has been shown to prevent transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to newborns. In addition, UNICEF is the largest distributor of antiretroviral medicines for children and pregnant women with HIV in the developing world.\n\nUNICEF also provides thousands of training opportunities for community health workers to deliver health services to children in their own communities. UNICEF, through its extensive network of child protection partners, also provides psychological support and counselling for children and adolescents affected by violence, abuse and exploitation. For millions of children who would otherwise die, it is UNICEF that saves lives.\n\nIn response to the global refugee crisis, UNICEF is at the forefront of emergency response efforts to help children and families who are fleeing conflict and violence. The agency has distributed more than 1 million emergency packages in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan, and has provided over 1.5 million people with emergency supplies including tents, kitchen sets, heaters and sleeping mats. UNICEF has established 41 child-friendly spaces for traumatized children in the region and continues to provide medical and psychosocial support, protection and assistance for refugees.\n\nIn 2016, UNICEF\u2019s commitment to the protection of children in conflict was formally recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Prize was awarded to UNICEF \u201cfor its work for children in developing countries, and for long-standing advocacy in favor of children\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and UNICEF first partnered in 1953, to help children devastated by the Korean War. From that time, their relationship has strengthened. In fiscal year 2015, the U.S. government provided UNICEF with more than $77 million to support its humanitarian efforts. UNICEF also works with the U.S. government on a number of global health initiatives. These include ensuring that every child is fully immunized and preventing HIV transmission from mother to child. UNICEF also works with the U.S. government on the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\nThrough PEPFAR, the U.S. government has invested more than $80 billion to combat global HIV/AIDS since 2003. PEPFAR is a cornerstone of U.S. global health efforts, and it is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease. The program provides 11 million people in over 50 countries with lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, and has contributed to a 40 percent decline in AIDS-related deaths since 2004. In fiscal year 2017, the U.S. contributed $4.2 billion to PEPFAR.\n\nChildren born with HIV and AIDS in Africa, including those living in remote rural areas, can now receive treatment.

I am a huge fan of using Twitter as a marketing tool, even more than Facebook. It\u2019s a great way to network and reach out to people who are interested in what you have to offer. Here is my list of 10 tips to help you promote anything you are selling on Twitter:\n\n1. Use Hashtags\n\nI love using hashtags on Twitter. They help to promote the things you are interested in and create a sense of community within a group. I will admit that it can be hard to remember hashtags to use for all the things you promote. One way I suggest to overcome this is to put your hashtags in a Twitter search to make sure they are not already being used. This will save you some time and help you avoid any issues down the road.\n\n2. Retweet\n\nIf you like a tweet, retweet it! I\u2019m sure most people are familiar with the concept of retweeting, but I just wanted to put it out there to make sure it was stated. Retweeting is a great way to share the things you like, and can be a great way to show your audience that you are involved in the social media community and help them feel more comfortable doing business with you.\n\n3. Mention\n\nMentioning someone on Twitter is a great way to show your audience that you are engaged and want to interact with them. It is important to mention other people within your field of interest in order to show your audience that you are well connected. I always make sure to mention people who have liked or retweeted my stuff as well. It makes me feel good when I get a mention and it shows that the people I engage with are interested in what I have to say.\n\n4. Post About Your Daily Life\n\nThere is nothing wrong with posting about your daily life and about other stuff you like. I\u2019m sure you all know about the Twitter feeds that are all business. I don\u2019t like following people like that because I feel like it takes away from the idea of the social aspect of Twitter. By being a person and talking about your life, you can show your audience that you are a real person and are interested in other people\u2019s lives as well. I\u2019m sure you have seen some tweets about people\u2019s lives that you thought were really cool, and the people that posted those tweets have engaged you because of it.\n\n5. Be Social\n\nDon\u2019t forget to be social. I\u2019m sure that when you first started out you didn\u2019t know what to do on Twitter. My suggestion to you is to find some people who are interested in the things you are and start a conversation. You will see that the conversations that start on Twitter are real and can be interesting. One of my favorite things to do on Twitter is to start conversations with people. It gives me the chance to learn from other people and also helps them learn about me.\n\n6. Use Pictures\n\nI love using pictures on Twitter. I know a lot of people like to include pictures when they post about things, and I would like to suggest that you do so as well. Including a picture with your tweet can get you more retweets and likes, and can really help to boost the effectiveness of your post. I like to use pictures from Instagram with my tweets, but you can really use any picture. If you want to make a picture of yourself that has an impact on your audience, I would suggest using a tool like Socialbakers.\n\n7. Use Hashtags That Make Sense\n\nI\u2019ve touched on this before, but I want to emphasize it again. It is important to make sure that you are using hashtags that make sense. You don\u2019t want to hashtag your tweets with irrelevant hashtags just to get a retweet or a like. You also don\u2019t want to make hashtags that are too long. I would suggest keeping your hashtags short and relevant.\n\n8. Direct Message\n\nThere are times when a DM is more appropriate than a tweet. You will be surprised at how many people DM you. I think a lot of people just use it to ask questions, but you can also use it to network. I think a lot of people don\u2019t use DMs because they don\u2019t think their audience will see it. If you are going to send a DM, make sure it is personal. Send it to someone who is following you. It\u2019s a lot less likely that they will check the people they follow to see who is sending them a DM, so if you DM a person that is following you, they are much more likely to respond.\n\n9. Use Images\n\nI want to encourage you to use images with your tweets. Images are the first thing people look at, so you want to make sure that you are using good images. One thing I like to do is to include images with my tweets. I\u2019m sure you have seen a lot of Twitter profiles that do this. It helps to keep your tweets interesting and make your tweets more unique.\n\n10. Be You\n\nThis last one is really important. You want to be yourself on Twitter. The more genuine you are, the better. People can see through a fake personality. You want to engage with your audience and show them who you are. When they see you as a real person, it will help to build a more trusting relationship between you and your audience.\n\nThere you have it!

First of all, you're expected to wear a hideous dress that you've never worn before. Second, you're required to spend your evening catering to everyone else, acting as the host of the event. Most importantly, however, you're required to smile a lot and appear happy.\n\nAt the wedding I attended, everyone was happy, especially the bride and groom. I was happy for them, but I wasn't the happiest bridesmaid in the crowd. In fact, I was the exact opposite.\n\nWhy was I so unhappy? I wasn't the one getting married; I was the maid of honor. I was so annoyed that I was even standing up for my ex. We'd broken up last month because I thought he was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer. I was at the wedding because my best friend Alicia insisted that I go, but if she knew how much I hated the groom, she would have probably asked me not to go at all.\n\nAnyway, this was the part of the wedding that was pissing me off: the proposal. I was trying my hardest to hold back my tears, but I was failing. I didn't love him anymore, and I never would again.\n\nI glanced over at my ex-boyfriend, Blake. He was really handsome, but that's not what was important right now. He was going down on one knee and was about to propose to the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.\n\n&quot;Andi, will you marry me?&quot;\n\nI cringed. He'd asked me the same question about ten times, but I was too busy being angry at him to remember. This time was different, however, because he was now asking the blonde bimbo he was sleeping with.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, finally accepting the proposal.\n\nAs soon as he slid the ring on her finger, everyone in the room erupted into cheers. I just stood there, my mouth wide open, in complete shock.\n\n&quot;Yes, that's my girl,&quot; said Blake, &quot;And now she's my fianc\xe9e!&quot;\n\nAs they walked out of the church and into the limo, Blake leaned over and kissed her cheek. A couple seconds later, I lost it.\n\n&quot;Bastard,&quot; I muttered. &quot;Bastard.&quot;\n\n&quot;Andrea?&quot; said Alicia.\n\n&quot;He just asked that whore to marry him,&quot; I said. &quot;It was my turn. I was the one who should have been there. I'm the one who was supposed to marry him!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, well I know that,&quot; she said, rolling her eyes. &quot;But it's over now. You just have to be a big girl and accept it.&quot;\n\n&quot;He doesn't love her,&quot; I said, &quot;I know it. He was with her while he was with me, remember?&quot;\n\n&quot;Andi, I hate to say this, but it's too late now,&quot; she said. &quot;He's getting married. You can't do anything about it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I could show up at the wedding,&quot; I said, &quot;and say that I'm his girlfriend and I'm pregnant.&quot;\n\n&quot;Andi, that's insane,&quot; she said. &quot;You know it's not your baby. You're going to destroy his wedding day if you pull something like that.&quot;\n\n&quot;That's the point,&quot; I said. &quot;I want him to feel the way I feel. I want him to feel miserable for a change.&quot;\n\n&quot;Look,&quot; she said, &quot;I'll go with you, but you can't tell Blake anything. If you do, you're going to be the biggest loser in the room, and you're going to lose your best friend.&quot;\n\nI hesitated. I knew she was right. If I ruined the wedding, I'd be in a lot of trouble.\n\n&quot;Fine,&quot; I said. &quot;I won't tell him anything.&quot;\n\nA few days later, I arrived at the church. The doors were open, so I wandered in. The church was completely empty, which made it look a lot bigger. I could hear some talking coming from the altar, so I walked in that direction. The first person I saw was Blake, wearing a brand new suit and looking like the happiest man on the planet.\n\n&quot;You look so beautiful,&quot; he said to the blonde bimbo who stood next to him.\n\nI thought I would be furious when I saw her, but I wasn't. I was heartbroken and sad, but I didn't hate her. In fact, I didn't feel anything towards her. I was just jealous, and the sight of her made me remember how much I'd wanted to marry Blake myself.\n\nI walked up the aisle, ignoring the fact that I was completely alone. I sat down in the front row, and began to think about what had happened.\n\n&quot;How did it happen?&quot; I said to myself. &quot;Why did we break up?&quot;\n\nI knew that I loved him, but I was certain he didn't love me. My best friend Alicia and I had discussed it, and she agreed with me. She was convinced that Blake was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer, but I wasn't convinced.\n\n&quot;It can't be her,&quot; I said. &quot;How did he meet her? Where did they meet?&quot;\n\nJust then, a woman walked up to the front of the church. She was dressed in a black robe, and she had short, black hair.\n\n&quot;Are you Andrea?&quot; she asked.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;but the wedding has been cancelled.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;Blake is getting married in Las Vegas,&quot; she said.\n\n&quot;But I'm his fianc\xe9e,&quot; I said, &quot;And I'm supposed to be here.&quot;\n\n&quot;You were never his fianc\xe9e,&quot; she said. &quot;The bimbo, Summer, is the one he's getting married to.&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't understand.&quot;\n\n&quot;Neither do I,&quot; she said, &quot;but I was supposed to tell you the wedding was cancelled. So, that's what I'm doing. Sorry for ruining your night.&quot;\n\n&quot;It's okay,&quot; I said. &quot;It's not your fault.&quot;\n\nI knew I had to get out of there. I could barely stand being there as it was, so I hurried out the door. I walked down the sidewalk, not knowing where I was going. I had no idea what to do next.\n\n&quot;Hey,&quot; said a voice behind me.\n\nI turned around and saw Blake running towards me.\n\n&quot;You were supposed to be at the wedding,&quot; he said. &quot;Where have you been?&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm not going to lie to you,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm really hurt, and I don't want to be in your wedding. I'm just here because your father paid for the wedding.&quot;\n\n&quot;You don't understand,&quot; he said. &quot;We're getting married in Las Vegas tonight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Really?&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;Andi, we've got to go,&quot; he said, &quot;it's going to start any second.&quot;\n\nI took one look at his face, and I knew that he was telling the truth. I felt the tears well up in my eyes.\n\n&quot;So, this is it?&quot; I said. &quot;You're really getting married?&quot;\n\n&quot;Andi, I'm sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't know how to tell you. My father forced me into this, and I couldn't say no. If I had it my way, you'd be my wife right now. But this is the way it has to be.&quot;\n\nI felt a tear escape my eye, and I quickly wiped it away.\n\n&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;I'm not going,&quot; I]" time="0.966"><properties><property name="score" value="0.041695569" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[4.25 stars - Review by Trisha\n\n\n\nIn my experience, most male-on-male romance books are really hot and steamy but the storyline is lacking, but this one definitely surpassed my expectations.

In an interview with Josh Radnor from earlier this year, he claimed he would only do a spin-off if it was centered around Ted and Barney, with the two of them going off to some far off place (New Zealand? Australia?) where they lived in a beach house and watched sports. I laughed. A lot. And now that I have come up with a sequel for The Only Person Who Didn't Run from Ted Mosby, I don't really have a plot for it...\n\n(Disclaimer: This is a work of fan fiction. Any resemblance to any other work of fiction is entirely coincidental. Not to mention a little insulting)\n\nI sat on my bed, looking down at my phone. There was only one person who could help me write this...\n\nI knew it was kind of a lame excuse. I mean, my sister works at a museum, for Pete's sake. She can't help me with a stupid paper. What was I thinking? And I had a really good excuse to tell my girlfriend when I get home. We had a date. But, in order to give me that good excuse, I have to write this stupid paper and get it done. I have to talk to my sister.\n\nI dialed the number to my sister's work, and it started ringing.

I need to know how to start a paper.&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm glad you asked.&quot;\n\nAnd I was off to a good start. I sat at my desk, making notes. The paper was going to be really easy to write. It would probably only take a couple hours. I knew it. And I would be home before Lily.\n\nThe paper was starting to look really good. I had a bibliography in place, a couple of good paragraphs, and a nice introduction. Everything was great.\n\nI had a paper ready to turn in the next morning. It was almost done, and I was free to go home. But I had a date to get to.\n\n&quot;Bartender!&quot; I called. &quot;One more, please!&quot;\n\n&quot;You sure, man? You're not gonna make it home tonight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Nah, man. It's all good. I'll just be getting home, like, ten minutes later than I would.&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay, man. Whatever you say.&quot;\n\nI started walking out the door, but I took the bar stool with me. I had to carry it around to make it look like I was in a drunken stupor. If my girlfriend saw that I was drunk when I got home, I would never be able to keep my secret.\n\nAs I made my way through the train station, I heard a strange beeping sound. I turned my head to the side, trying to find the source of the noise. It was coming from my phone. There was a text message. I opened my phone, and read it.\n\nI was starting to feel a little tipsy. It was a good thing I was carrying a bar stool around. It made me look like I had a reason for not walking right.\n\nThe message was from Lily.

John McCain died after a yearlong battle with brain cancer.\n\nMy fellow Republicans, John McCain was a true American hero. https://t.co/YlNEJ2KRAS \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) August 26, 2018\n\nArizona Sen. John McCain, the maverick Republican whose war record and outspokenness against abuses of power made him an American icon, died on Saturday. He was 81.In a statement, McCain\u2019s office said he died at 4:28 pm local time at the family\u2019s home in Arizona surrounded by family members. The cause of death was not immediately known.The former Navy pilot, who was imprisoned and tortured during the Vietnam War, rose to the top of American politics after emerging as a prominent critic of President Donald Trump.An upstart presidential bid in 2000 did not succeed but after he won the Republican nomination in 2008, he lost to Democrat Barack Obama.Despite the loss, his image soared and he emerged as one of the most influential members of the Senate, willing to work with Democrats on issues like campaign finance reform.By the time he ran for president again in 2016, he seemed like a throwback to a bygone era of civility and bipartisanship. McCain ran against Obama again in 2008.He continued to play a pivotal role in American politics, becoming chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee after the Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2015.McCain in the past had been a thorn in the side of Republican presidents \u2014 George W. Bush and Trump.He was also well known for reaching across the aisle.He took a secret trip to visit Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad during the early years of the country\u2019s civil war, and was one of the final Republicans to speak with the president before his firing last year.He was a long-time critic of the U.S. use of torture against detainees.He held out against Republicans\u2019 efforts to dismantle Obama\u2019s signature healthcare legislation and refused to support the Graham-Cassidy bill last year.He was a harsh critic of Russia, and one of the earliest supporters of sanctions against Russian officials. He played a role in seeking to keep the United States from launching a pre-emptive attack against North Korea in the face of its nuclear provocations.McCain was one of the first Republicans to support Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016. But when the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape emerged, he withdrew his support, and famously said in his 2017 memoir \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d \u201cI do not know how I could have spoken so disrespectfully about the commander in chief of the Armed Forces.\u201dHe also repeatedly denounced what he called Trump\u2019s \u201ccheap rhetoric and insults\u201d against U.S. allies, and after Trump\u2019s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2018, called it a \u201ctragic mistake.\u201d He was one of the loudest Republican voices criticizing the president for his performance at a summit with Putin in Helsinki.Trump mocked him as \u201ca clown,\u201d and even at the end of his life, he was still a target for the president, who reportedly resisted hosting a state funeral.On Saturday, Trump said he sent his \u201cdeepest sympathies and respect\u201d to McCain\u2019s family.\u201cThe nation mourns the loss of a great American patriot, a statesman who put his country first and enriched this nation every day he served.\u201dFormer President Barack Obama called him a \u201cgiant of American politics,\u201d and his one-time opponent in the 2008 presidential race said he was \u201ca man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order.\u201dPresidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, called McCain \u201can American hero\u201d on Twitter.McCain\u2019s funeral service will be held at the Washington National Cathedral and the ceremony will include eulogies from former President George W. Bush, former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Sen. Joe Lieberman, the former vice-presidential candidate who was a close friend.After the service, he will be buried in Annapolis, Md., at the U.S. Naval Academy.McCain was born at a naval station in the Panama Canal Zone, where his father was stationed. After his father\u2019s career in the Navy, the family settled in the Arizona desert, where he attended high school.McCain studied at the Naval Academy and became a pilot in the Navy, serving on a ship that was shot down in Vietnam. He spent five-and-a-half years in captivity, which included torture, before he was released in 1973.McCain returned to the U.S. and was assigned to the Senate as a liaison to the Navy. He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1983 and eventually the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce.During his 2008 presidential bid, he secured the GOP nomination in the face of much skepticism. At a dinner in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama joked that after losing to Obama, McCain would be on a beach sipping a drink with \u201can umbrella in it.\u201dThe Republican-led Senate, which was much closer to McCain than to the president, overwhelmingly passed a resolution earlier this year that censured Trump for his \u201cbigoted and racist\u201d remarks about four members of Congress.In his memoir, McCain said that he regretted that his choice of Sarah Palin as a running mate did not propel him to the White House. He said he made the choice based on who he thought could become president, but that was wrong.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

Card left running stress-test until power draw converged to a stable value.\n\nBlu-ray Playback: Power DVD 9 Ultra was used at a resolution of 1920x1200 to play back the Batman: The Dark Knight disc with GPU acceleration turned on. Playback started around timecode 1:19, which has the highest data rates on the BD with up to 40 Mb/s. Playback was left running until power draw converged to a stable value.\n\nCooling modern video cards is becoming more and more difficult, especially when users are asking for quiet cooling solutions. That's why the engineers are now paying much more attention to power consumption of new video-card designs.For this test, we measured the power consumption of the graphics card only via the PCI-Express power connector(s) and PCI-Express bus slot. A Keithley Integra 2700 digital multimeter with 6.5-digit resolution was used for all measurements. Again, the values here reflect only the power consumption of the card measured at DC VGA card inputs, not of the whole system.We choseas a standard test representing typical 3D gaming usage because it offers the following: very high power draw; high repeatability; is a current game that is supported on all cards because of its DirectX 9 roots; drivers are actively tested and optimized for it; supports all multi-GPU configurations; test runs in a relatively short time and renders a non-static scene with variable complexity.To measure the power consumption of our testbed we used a digital power meter (Keithley Integra 2700) connected before the power supply. The power consumption measurement of the system is based on the power consumption of the drives, not of the graphics cards. All cards were tested with a total of four SSDs: one in the system, one used as a primary test drive in a slot without a powered connector, and two additional drives in the system (not used for testing). The SSDs are Western Digital WD360GD (362GB), WD1500HLHX (150GB), Samsung SSD 830 (128GB) and OCZ Agility 3 (240GB).Idle power consumption of the whole test system (at the desktop) is measured after sitting idle at the desktop for 30 minutes. The cards are not closed. The result is presented as the average value of all four cards.Please note that after extensive testing, we found that measuring idle power consumption only, as seen in many other reviews, can be misleading. Due to different testing methodology and environments, this number can be significantly lower than the real power consumption. Also, in many cases, the card does not reach the desired idle temperature, so it will draw more power. In our test setup, the cards reach their idle temperature very quickly (in a few minutes) and in a climate controlled room (22\xb0C).Therefore, we use this only as a rough indication of the cards' power consumption.Please note we are using different adjustements to test the performance of our graphics cards. Our testing methodology is detailed here . It's worth mentioning that our method allows us to perform a more thorough test that's free from GPU bottlenecks. It's also free from variations caused by dual-gpu/hybrid configurations.The following two values are the peak power consumption and the maximum power consumption of our testbed (without speakers/headphones) measured after long periods of use (at least 15 minutes) with Windows Aero enabled. The peak power consumption is the maximum power draw of the graphics card only, measured in the most stressful situation (generally, when it's overclocked). The maximum power consumption is the maximum power draw of the complete testbed, including the monitor, speakers, hard-disk, SSD, etc.The results are impressive. Idle power consumption is a tiny bit higher than that of the GTX 580. All cards operate at fairly low power levels in idle. NVIDIA has done a good job reducing idle power consumption of its GTX 680. Under full load, the GTX 680 is only slightly more power hungry than the GTX 580. Compared to AMD, the GTX 680 fares even better as it uses slightly less power than the HD 7970.All graphics cards tested consume quite a lot of power during Blu-ray playback. Interestingly, this is one area where NVIDIA can't keep up with AMD.]" time="0.913"><properties><property name="score" value="0.136673628" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.13667363&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.13667363

He was a descendant of John Kearney (1635\u20131701), a native of Ireland who was the first of the family to settle in what became the United States. John's son Richard (1668\u20131734) was born in Bristol, England, but became a fur trader in what was then the English colonies and later became New Jersey. Richard was commissioned as an ensign by British colonial governor Jonathan Belcher in 1709.\n\nRichard's son James (1703\u20131785) was a general in the New Jersey colonial militia during the French and Indian War. James's son Stephen Watts Kearny, the namesake of the general, was a captain in the War of Independence and was at the surrender of General John Burgoyne. His home, the Kearney Mansion, has since been preserved in Newark.\n\nIn 1794 he moved with his parents to Louisville, Kentucky. His father, Alexander Morris Kearney, a native of South Carolina, was a captain in the American Revolutionary War. In the War of 1812, Kearney participated in the Battle of Lundy's Lane, where he was wounded and captured by the British. After being released, he joined the Missouri Rangers and, in 1813, married Mary Radcliffe Matthews. In 1814 he joined the 5th United States Infantry as its sixth lieutenant and served in the war against the Creek nation. In 1819 he was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry. Kearney resigned from the Army in 1822 and became superintendent of Indian affairs at St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn 1832 Kearney was appointed as governor of the New Mexico Territory, where he was active in promoting settlement and negotiating treaties with the Native Americans. Kearney participated in the Gila Expedition of 1837 and then commanded the Army's Third Dragoon Regiment in Florida in 1837 and 1838.\n\nDuring the Mexican\u2013American War, Kearney was appointed colonel of the 1st New York Dragoons on June 30, 1846. Kearney's new regiment was sent to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to reinforce the Army of New Mexico under Col. Stephen Watts Kearny (no relation). There they joined the march on the capital of Mexico City. On the way, Kearney's regiment carried out several successful raids, including the Battle of La Mesa, where he captured a large amount of ammunition and supplies. He took the Puebla de Los Angeles without opposition on December 7, 1846. There he received word that his promotion to brigadier general had been approved.\n\nKearny, reinforced by the 3rd Infantry and Mormon Battalion, took the city of Monterrey on September 25, 1846. During the battle, a cannonball tore away part of Kearny's jaw and neck.\n\nFollowing the battle, Kearney was carried to Saltillo for medical treatment. While he was recovering, Lt. Colonel John Garland was given command of the 1st Dragoons. In February 1847, Kearney returned to the army and resumed command of the dragoons. Kearney served in the Battle of Buena Vista, and later he fought in the Taos Revolt. He returned to the United States in October 1847 and was assigned to Fort Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory.\n\nKearney, a bachelor, died of cholera at Fort Leavenworth at the age of 54. He was buried in the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery.\n\nSeveral U.S. Army installations are named in honor of Kearney, including Kearney Barracks in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, the Kearney Building at Fort Leavenworth, and Fort Kearny, Nebraska, which is now a state historic site.\n\n\n]" time="0.327"><properties><property name="score" value="0.37364724" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.37364724&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.37364724

According to the World Health Organization, &quot;in countries with very low fertility, the proportion of young people may halve in the next 40 years&quot;. At this rate, by 2100 a majority of the world's population will be over 50. We will then have to find a way to accommodate the needs and aspirations of an unprecedented number of very old people in a society that has been moulded for decades around the needs of youth.\n\nNowhere is this more true than in Japan, the world's fastest-ageing country. The greying of Japan \u2013 &quot;silver tsunami&quot; or &quot;grey goo&quot; as it is known \u2013 is by now well known. There are a number of reasons for this. Japanese have one of the longest life expectancies in the world, with women expected to live to 87 and men to 80. Meanwhile, a long-standing national emphasis on having small families and long working hours \u2013 for both men and women \u2013 have kept the birth rate below replacement levels. And Japan's postwar economic miracle has not been kind to the young. The country's population is shrinking, partly because of a low birth rate and partly because of a high level of immigration.\n\nBut what is less well known is that this graying of Japan \u2013 and other nations such as Germany, China, South Korea and Thailand \u2013 is not just due to longer life expectancy and lower birth rates. There is another factor in play, and one that could have dramatic implications: very low fertility rates, particularly among younger women. It's estimated that around a quarter of the population will be aged over 65 by 2050.\n\nIn Japan, the &quot;total fertility rate&quot; (the number of children a woman is likely to have in her lifetime) is just 1.4 \u2013 and has been for the past 20 years. Among women aged between 15 and 24, the rate is even lower at 0.8, lower even than the famously low rate in Germany (which is 1.38). And in Tokyo, that rate is even lower at 0.7. By contrast, in 2010, the average rate in Europe was 1.6. The fertility rate in England and Wales in 2010 was 1.9.\n\nThe world's media are full of breathless stories about Japan's crisis of depopulation. Last year, an article in the International Business Times said that &quot;Japanese women are rejecting marriage and motherhood at a staggering rate&quot;. In the New York Times, another piece claimed that Japan is &quot;exporting its young women&quot; and is now &quot;facing a demographic crisis of epic proportions&quot;. More soberly, the BBC's business editor Robert Peston has written: &quot;Without a dramatic increase in its birth rate, Japan will face economic and social ruin.&quot;\n\nThe sense of panic is understandable. &quot;The number of young people will go down by two-thirds by 2035,&quot; says demographer Toshio Kanazawa. &quot;That means not only a decline in the size of the workforce but a dramatic increase in the number of retirees. Who will pay for them?&quot;\n\nThe answer is &quot;women&quot; \u2013 or more specifically, their wombs. And in this, there is something not quite right.\n\nIn Tokyo, I meet Nana, a 29-year-old who is employed in the financial sector. She is smartly dressed in a suit and speaks good English. She tells me she has a boyfriend and they are very happy. She is, she says, the typical &quot;She Economy&quot; \u2013 a young woman working in the city and her parents are very pleased. &quot;They want me to settle down,&quot; she says, &quot;and have children.&quot; But she's not so sure.\n\n&quot;It's too late,&quot; she says. &quot;I've got to think of my future. And I just don't know if I could afford it \u2013 having children. I'd need a bigger flat, and pay for childcare, and a new car.&quot;\n\nFor Nana, and for many Japanese women like her, the economic reality of having children is daunting. &quot;I have two brothers,&quot; she says, &quot;and they have wives and children. The wives don't work, and they have one or two children. One of my sisters-in-law doesn't even work outside the house. They don't have much money, but my parents love them. They are very happy. So I know what my parents want for me. But it's impossible. I can't do it.&quot;\n\nThis is a scenario that is playing out in homes across the country. The situation is, in many respects, rather unique. As Peston points out, Japanese women who stay in employment tend to have children later. As a result, while there is a generation of Japanese in their early 30s who have given up on having children, there is a generation of younger women who are still trying to get pregnant.\n\n&quot;I think it's pretty much impossible to have two or three children in Tokyo,&quot; says Seiko, a 35-year-old marketing executive. &quot;I don't think I could afford it. You have to pay so much for childcare. And then, you've got to give up work. I just couldn't do it.\n\n&quot;But, still, my mother is pressuring me to have children. If you have a boyfriend, you can't get married. It's impossible. You have to marry first, then have children. So, if you are a working woman, you have to get married, have children, and then stay at home with your children. That's it. And that's what everyone wants. That's the ideal.&quot;\n\nAt the root of this ideal is Japan's traditional gender-role society \u2013 one that has stayed remarkably the same since the end of the second world war. It is not, perhaps, surprising that such a rigid society is under strain. And not only for women. It is also under strain for men.\n\n&quot;Women in Japan are not treated well,&quot; says Toshio Kanazawa. &quot;They don't earn a lot of money. They are discriminated against in many ways. That's why there aren't enough babies.&quot;\n\nNot everyone agrees. &quot;I don't think it's true,&quot; says Nana, who, I've noticed, has referred to herself as &quot;boku&quot; (which means &quot;I&quot;) all evening, rather than the more feminine &quot;watashi&quot; (which means &quot;I&quot;). &quot;Women in Japan are strong. They do well at work and they earn a lot of money. They can do everything. So why should they have children?&quot;\n\nIn some respects, Nana has a point. Japan is a country in which young women are breaking glass ceilings. The number of women in senior management in Japan's 3,000 largest companies is at a record high. And in 2013, the World Economic Forum rated Japan the fourth most &quot;gender-equal&quot; nation in the world.\n\nThe Japanese government has encouraged this development. Ever since the Second World War, successive prime ministers have tried to get more women into the workplace and have even gone so far as to tell men to &quot;say goodbye to their bonuses if they refuse to let their wives and daughters work outside the home&quot;.\n\nBut while some Japanese women are finding their way into senior positions, many are also facing a harsh reality: most large Japanese corporations have an unofficial &quot;marriage bar&quot; that prohibits the promotion of women who are married and have children. This is particularly true of men. According to a study by the Japanese government, 61.5 per cent of male managers are married. By contrast, only 42.2 per cent of female managers are married. This means that women with children can be in a very difficult position, because \u2013 as Shihoko Goto of the Wilson Center points out \u2013 they face a choice between marriage and career. And that is not a choice that men face.\n\n&quot;If you look at people in their 30s,&quot; says Seiko, &quot;I think many of them are not getting married and having children. If you don't have children, you have more time and money to enjoy your life. So why not?\n\n&quot;I don't think that women are rejecting marriage and family,&quot; she says. &quot;It's just that if you want children and you are a career woman, it's impossible. There is no way. You can't do both. And so you have to make a choice. Either you go for your career or you go for marriage and family. That's what I think is happening.&quot;\n\n&quot;In Japan,&quot; says Goto, &quot;it's very difficult for men and women to be able to balance work and family. So, if you are a career woman, you will have to sacrifice family. That's the problem. That's why so many women don't have children. Because they want to focus on their career.&quot;\n\nThis is a view echoed by Ai Kato, a 29-year-old tax accountant. &quot;It's true that if you work in a large Japanese company, you cannot get married or have children if you want to keep your job,&quot; she says. &quot;That's the reality. It's a matter of the company culture. It's difficult to balance both. And so people are having fewer children.&quot;\n\nJapan has never really known anything else. &quot;Since the Meiji era [from 1868 to 1912] Japan's population has been very stable,&quot; says Kanazawa. &quot;So they think that is normal. But it's not. If you look at Germany, their population is falling too, but they are getting immigrants. And in the US and the UK, the population is stable, but people are having more children. So there are many different types of demographic change, and Japan is one of the most extreme.&quot;\n\nWhat is less clear is why this is happening. The popular explanation is that Japan is a victim of the phenomenon known as the &quot;demographic time bomb&quot; or &quot;]" time="0.657"><properties><property name="score" value="0.056043313333333344" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Australian Computer Emergency Response Team\n\nThe Australian Computer Emergency Response Team (AusCERT) is the recognised national computer security incident response team of the Australian Government.

In January 2013, AusCERT relocated to the City of Melbourne.\n\nAusCERT is a specialist organisation that provides advice and assistance in computer security incidents to its constituent members. As an operational unit, AusCERT:\n\n\nAusCERT's incident management process incorporates the Australian Signals Directorate's Incident Handling Working Model, an approved Australian Standard, AS 4801-2005.\n\nAusCERT is the designated lead agency for computer security incidents within Australia's Critical Infrastructure community, as defined by the Communications and the Arts portfolio of the Commonwealth Government.\n\nSince 2001, AusCERT has been responsible for issuing national warnings and alerts on a number of security issues, as directed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).\n\n\nAusCERT is active in a number of national and international computer security forums. AusCERT regularly participates in the Cyber Storm exercises conducted by the US Department of Homeland Security, as well as the Cyber Storm exercises hosted by the Singapore Infocomm Development Authority. AusCERT has also participated in the Cyber Security Exercise Series (CSES) developed by the Government of New Zealand. In 2003, AusCERT attended the UK's National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC) / British Computer Emergency Response Team (BCERT) course, and was the first international agency to receive the NISCC's Advanced Incident Handling course.\n\nOn 8 September 2005, AusCERT signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to formalise cooperation in the areas of:\n\n\n]" time="0.305"><properties><property name="score" value="0.22993536" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.22993536&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.22993536

On July 18, 2005, Ahmed Harkat was arrested under a Security Certificate by the Government of Canada, at his home in Ottawa, on the grounds that he was involved in terrorist activities, in particular in association with the al-Qaeda organization. On November 23, 2005, Ahmed Harkat was detained indefinitely by the Federal Court. He was released on strict house arrest conditions on February 1, 2006, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that his detention was unconstitutional. On December 13, 2007, the Court of Appeal for Ontario found that Harkat was detained lawfully. However, the Court ordered a new detention review hearing to be held before the end of June 2008. The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal on February 15, 2008.\n\nHarkat applied for a judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Public Safety to order his detention. The Federal Court of Canada dismissed his application on December 14, 2006. Harkat has appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Federal Court decision came a week after the United States Senate rejected a bill to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nIn August 2008, Harkat was living under 24-hour house arrest, with some restrictions.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the security certificate under which Harkat was detained was valid and that he must be deported.\n\nOn July 29, 2015, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld a lower court decision and ruled that Harkat could stay in Canada. The ruling meant that Harkat could not be removed from Canada and remained under a strict form of house arrest.\n\nOn January 12, 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal.\n\nAhmed Harkat was born in Pakistan in 1971, and he came to Canada in 1995. He speaks some English and has a wife and three daughters. He is a pizza delivery driver in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nHarkat worked in Peshawar, Pakistan as a relief coordinator for Care International Pakistan, an international humanitarian organization, until 1999. He then went on to work as an accountant and cashier at Afghan Relief in Peshawar, a project of the National Council for Voluntary Social Services (NCVSS).\n\nHarkat came to the attention of Canadian intelligence officials after being deported from Dubai in April 2000, after he failed to obtain a visa for the United States. He has never visited Afghanistan, a key requirement of a security certificate. Harkat also states that he was not involved in any terrorist activity, and has never supported or associated with a terrorist organization.\n\nHarkat was arrested on December 10, 2002. He was charged with knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity and knowingly participating in the activities of a terrorist group.\n\nOn January 23, 2003, a judge granted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an order to monitor his activities and to search his home. On March 20, 2003, Harkat was released under a strict curfew. The surveillance and house arrest was lifted on September 11, 2003.\n\nOn February 10, 2004, the judge in the case ruled that Harkat would not be allowed to work as a relief coordinator in his community or to interact with a list of specified persons, including the media. On March 10, 2004, Harkat's curfew was changed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., and the list of people he was not allowed to contact was expanded to include more than 100 people, including several Members of Parliament.\n\nOn May 11, 2004, the judge in the case ruled that Harkat would not be allowed to attend community events, and that he would be required to meet regularly with RCMP officials.\n\nOn August 16, 2004, Harkat was accused of writing love letters to two married women, one of whom was an RCMP officer.\n\nOn September 15, 2004, the Attorney General of Canada, under Paul Martin, asked that Harkat be detained for an additional six months, which was approved by a judge on October 12.\n\nOn September 30, 2004, Harkat's wife, Sophie, appeared on a news show, the &quot;National Magazine&quot; on CBC.\n\nOn January 21, 2005, the Federal Court of Canada ordered Harkat to remain under a 24-hour surveillance and under house arrest.

Overall, this means that it'll be easier to reach the minimum Attack Speed slow but harder to reach the maximum Attack Speed slow.\n\nAlso, this means Exhaust won't affect attack speed-based champs as much because it'll take more time for the debuff to tick down.\n\nWe'll continue to assess Exhaust and other individual adjustments to hit our goals in the pre-season.]" time="0.367"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0029578016" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.0029578&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.0029578

No Benefit.\n\nThere will be exceptions for those who cannot work due to illness or disability, and those in serious financial hardship.\n\nThose who had been receiving a sickness or invalids benefit, such as the invalids benefit, the sickness benefit, or the severe disabilities benefit for at least six months in the past two years, will be exempt from the tougher requirements.\n\nHowever, all job seekers who had been on a sickness benefit for six months or more would be required to actively look for a job, even if they were on a sickness benefit.\n\nThe measures, contained in a Ministry of Social Development discussion paper, would apply to new and existing beneficiaries.\n\nThey would also apply to beneficiaries who are looking after a child under six months old, or a child who is in the &quot;prescribed age range&quot; of six to 12 months, or is aged under two years old.\n\nPeople with children over two years old would be expected to look for work once the youngest child turned two.\n\nBennett said jobseekers needed to be active and look for work, rather than wait to be told what to do.\n\n&quot;We don't think the system is working very well at the moment. The policy is asking for more people to go into paid employment.&quot;\n\nThe Government is under pressure to get more people into work, particularly with a labour shortage.\n\nJob vacancies were at a 10-year high, but there were not enough skilled workers to fill them, Work and Income chief executive Glenys Coughlan said.\n\nThere were also not enough job offers to meet the needs of unemployed people, Bennett said.\n\n&quot;We know there are around 28,000 job seekers who have been unemployed for a year or more, and nearly 30,000 unemployed who have been unemployed for at least two years,&quot; Bennett said.\n\n&quot;We want to get these people into the workforce.&quot;\n\nThe Government's target is for 55 per cent of people aged between 18 and 64 to be in paid work by the end of this year.\n\n&quot;This is a national problem. It's going to require a lot of hard work from all of us to solve it.&quot;\n\nThe discussion document is out for public consultation, and the measures are likely to be introduced in September.\n\nIf the measures are adopted, there will be increased reporting requirements, and consequences for not meeting work obligations.\n\nThere will be four levels of compliance measures.\n\n&quot;Where a person is placed at the highest level of compliance with their obligations, it would mean that a person may be subject to reduced or no benefit payments if they are not meeting their obligations,&quot; the discussion paper said.\n\nPeople on a benefit would be expected to have regular interviews with a case manager, and have mandatory obligations to get training and development.\n\n&quot;The expectation is that the person will be actively looking for work, and not sitting on the benefit,&quot; Bennett said.\n\n&quot;They can say no to jobs, but they will still need to look.&quot;\n\nThose who refused a job offer three times would be placed on the work preparation programme. They would be expected to actively look for work, and attend job interviews, if they were suitable for the position.\n\nIf the person did not have a suitable job offer, they would be expected to participate in the work preparation programme.\n\nThose on a benefit who refused to participate in the programme would have their benefit reduced.\n\nWork and Income would also actively seek out job opportunities, and encourage beneficiaries to apply for the jobs.\n\nBennett said the work preparation programme would not be mandatory.\n\nBut &quot;if you have two years of not being in work, you should probably have a little bit of pressure on you to do a little bit more&quot;.\n\n&quot;I wouldn't want to see a situation where there was lots of sanctions. I think there will be exceptions.&quot;\n\nThe work programme already had a requirement for those who were work-ready to actively seek out work.\n\nThe changes were &quot;very targeted&quot;, she said.\n\n&quot;If you've been on a benefit for a long time, we want to make sure you are taking steps to get into work.\n\n&quot;It's about saying to people 'get with it or we'll move you along'.&quot;\n\nThe tighter requirements for beneficiaries were part of a wider review of the welfare system.\n\nThe changes could see beneficiaries' obligations reduced if they were taking care of a seriously ill or dying family member.\n\nBut if the sickness was self-inflicted, such as drug and alcohol abuse, there could be tougher requirements.\n\nCoughlan said there was already a work-ready requirement for job seekers, but that it was flexible.\n\n&quot;I think we're not as prescriptive as Australia. I think they're much more prescriptive.&quot;\n\nShe said it was important to keep the labour market up to date.\n\n&quot;That's part of our focus, to make sure that we've got the market that matches up with the right skills.&quot;\n\nThere had already been a move towards a more results-based approach, she said.\n\n&quot;We're already in the business of 'what are the outcomes for the people we serve'?&quot;\n\nThe discussion document said the proposed measures would help reduce the number of beneficiaries, while supporting those who were genuinely unable to work.\n\n&quot;It is proposed that these policy changes will provide a tighter fit between the requirements for beneficiaries to engage in paid work, and the exceptions to those requirements,&quot; it said.\n\nThe new measures are part of the Government's welfare reforms.\n\n&quot;There is a real concern that people are falling out of the benefit system.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too far fetched to say that Bruce is the Scottish version of Neil Buchanan in American Psycho. Not necessarily in terms of the content of the story, but in the sheer fact that he is a very messed up guy, one who people can\u2019t stand, but at the same time can\u2019t stop looking at him.\n\nThis character is played to perfection by Jonny Lee Miller in the new film adaptation of Filth. The novel follows Bruce Robertson (Miller) a detective who, after starting the story off as a drunken, bitter asshole, finds out that he has cancer and so takes leave to get himself checked out. This action in turn leads to Bruce discovering that he is actually a massive pervert. He becomes obsessed with performing the most unspeakable of actions in order to be like the perverts that he so despises. The film follows Bruce as he conducts an investigation to find the person responsible for him being a terrible person and while he is still struggling with his illness.\n\nWhat is great about this adaptation is that it keeps the nastiness and the gritty, unpleasant content that is in the book. That might be what stops this film from being a complete success because this film is a difficult watch. It\u2019s not so difficult because of the content but because you will be so incredibly frustrated by the main character. He is an unpleasant person who you don\u2019t want to spend time with.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to Miller\u2019s performance that he makes you want to keep watching even though you can\u2019t stand him. It\u2019s this nastiness that he exudes that makes him so engaging to watch. You will want to know how his investigation turns out and what his next move is, because he is truly awful. It also helps that he looks incredibly creepy, like he would kill someone at the slightest provocation.\n\nBruce is helped by a fantastic supporting cast. Jon Skellern plays Bruce\u2019s best friend Simon. You can tell that Simon has his concerns for Bruce and that his concern for him will only continue to grow as Bruce\u2019s behaviour becomes worse. Simon acts as the voice of reason when it comes to Bruce and does his best to help him, only to be shut down by Bruce\u2019s barbs and by Bruce himself. Kelly Macdonald plays Bruce\u2019s wife Susan. While Bruce gets into scrapes with his fellow detectives, Susan is struggling to cope with him and his illness. It\u2019s obvious that Susan is struggling with her husband\u2019s condition, and you will feel for her throughout the film.\n\nThere are a lot of big names in this film that will be recognisable to most people. Jonny Lee Miller, so good as Sherlock Holmes, plays Bruce with a brilliant blend of ferocity and uncertainty. While he is fully committed to the disgusting nature of his character, he also seems like he could completely lose it at any minute. Stephen Fry is outstanding as Inspector Siobhan Clarke, who is one of the few people who is able to make Bruce think twice about the things he does. Everyone is perfectly cast and help to make this film feel incredibly authentic.\n\nThe film does do a good job of adapting the book. Although the source material is sometimes over the top, the film takes that feeling and amplifies it to the next level. What is great about this film is that you do believe that all the characters are real people. You get a real sense of the community that Bruce has around him and that is what helps to make the film so engaging. You want to know what is going to happen to Bruce and how he is going to get out of the situations that he has put himself into.\n\nFilth is a good adaptation of the novel by Irvine Welsh. It does have the same nastiness that is in the novel, which is great for those of you who enjoy watching people doing things that you shouldn\u2019t be watching. The acting is excellent, with a standout performance from Jonny Lee Miller, who takes the idea of a horrible person to a whole new level. It\u2019s not the most pleasant of films to watch, but it\u2019s certainly one of the most engaging.]" time="0.289"><properties><property name="score" value="0.03332567" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.03332567&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.03332567

I just spent about two hours on CSPAN watching the Committee's hearings about Puerto Rico. Not once was the possibility of debt restructuring, which would mean debt reduction, mentioned. All that was mentioned was higher taxes, pension cuts, and deep government spending cuts, on top of what Puerto Rico is already doing. A complete deadlock. Puerto Rico has been austerity-impaired for a long time now, and has experienced a 12% drop in GDP as a result. No one can grow their way out of debt. Yet, even with this depression-like economy, Puerto Rico is still paying a huge amount of its income to its creditors. A lot of that debt comes from bonds that the government of Puerto Rico sold to investors to get the money to cover the huge losses that its electricity monopoly incurred because of oil price spikes. The government still has no way to fix that, since electricity is now being generated by private companies, due to a privatization law passed in 2013. The government of Puerto Rico could offer a debt exchange to investors, swapping the current bonds for ones with a longer maturity date and a lower interest rate, and then reinvest the proceeds into infrastructure projects, where it has a big deficit. But that possibility is completely ruled out. On the other side, the creditors are as intransigent as ever. They claim they can sue the US government if it tries to change their contracts, which is not true. They also claim that Puerto Rico is defaulting on its debt already, which is also not true. The government of Puerto Rico has been paying its creditors 100 cents on the dollar. There is simply no default risk. This is all a huge waste of time. All that the Puerto Rico hearings did was show that the US Congress is not capable of doing what it should have done long ago: allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debts. That would have given Puerto Rico a fresh start, and the creditors would have ended up with their money back. And we would have avoided all this useless talking. Now, we are just wasting time and making the situation worse. Puerto Rico's economy continues to decline. Puerto Rico's economy is expected to contract again by at least 1% in 2016, and another 2% in 2017. Most of the business owners I interviewed in Puerto Rico last month said they expect business to get worse in 2017. So the longer the creditors keep Puerto Rico in this situation, the worse it will get. In the hearings today, several senators brought up a resolution that the House of Representatives passed yesterday in a partisan vote, saying that Puerto Rico is already in default. That resolution is just to make a political point. The Supreme Court has already ruled that Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy like a US municipality can, and cannot restructure its debt in a court. This was because of a law that was passed in 1984. The US Congress could have changed this law a long time ago, but they did not. The Republicans in the House of Representatives, however, do not want to restructure Puerto Rico's debts. Instead, they are trying to force the government of Puerto Rico to do all the reforms it already is doing, without giving it the opportunity to do the debt restructuring that will put its economy back on track. This was not really mentioned in the Senate hearings, but I found out from reporters that the Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee are not going to move forward with the House resolution. They understand that it is not going to pass. We need Congress to pass the resolution anyway, just to show that it has bipartisan support. In the House hearings, Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin said, &quot;This is not an emergency.&quot; This is a statement that no one in Puerto Rico agrees with. By delaying the debt restructuring, the economy of Puerto Rico is getting worse. More people are moving to the US mainland, which will further reduce the income that Puerto Rico is able to collect in taxes. More people are being forced to do cash jobs in the underground economy, because they cannot find other jobs. And those jobs do not get reported to the government. The longer this process is delayed, the worse it will get. But the creditors and some members of Congress do not seem to understand that Puerto Rico needs a fresh start. So they will continue to waste time, talking about things that are already being done, without any hope of any positive outcome. Puerto Rico's creditors just don't want to take a loss. But we are not doing Puerto Rico any favors by letting this situation continue for so long.]" time="0.344"><properties><property name="score" value="0.00902413" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00902413&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00902413

It is not an uncommon story in that many physicians cannot get paid by insurance companies for a variety of reasons. The difference in this story is that this physician not only tried to get paid, but took the insurance company to court to try to get paid.\n\nIt started when a physician sent an invoice to an insurance company for services rendered. The physician was told that the insurance company did not have the funds to pay the invoice and that they would pay the bill at a later date. The physician sent the insurance company a bill every month for about a year until the insurance company stopped communicating. The physician was then advised by a collection agency that if he wanted to be paid, he would have to take the insurance company to court.\n\nThe physician then did just that. He filed a claim with the District Court seeking the unpaid bill plus interest and costs. The insurance company tried to have the case dismissed by claiming the physician did not have standing to sue. The insurance company argued that the physician only had a contractual right to be paid, but that right had not been breached. They also argued that he could not have been damaged by their failure to pay since it was their money.\n\nThe physician won the case. He was awarded the $10,600 plus interest and costs. The judge agreed that the insurance company breached the contract when it failed to pay the bill. The judge also found that the insurance company's withholding of payment did cause the physician to suffer damages in the form of legal fees to pursue payment.\n\nAs for the insurance company, it is probably a good idea that they got caught.

Especially when you live with more than two people, which I do. Most of the time, everything is on a schedule. No one is allowed to eat at 11pm unless they're hungry. Everyone is not allowed to leave dirty dishes in the sink unless they're at work. If you're working out at a certain time, you have to shower. No one can go outside unless it's to throw out the garbage. And so on and so forth.\n\nFor some reason, though, the whole &quot;organization&quot; idea flies right out the window when I'm trying to schedule a trip. I tend to plan things to the day and then get annoyed if something goes wrong or someone else wants to do something that may interfere. I hate it when someone wants to do something at a time that I've already booked for another thing. I feel like I should have priority, especially since I've planned this whole thing and if it were cancelled, I would have to pay for everything anyway.\n\nBut, guess what? I've realized I'm wrong. I've realized that while I may have planned the whole thing, other people need to be included too. And that they deserve a say in what goes on too. Maybe that means they have to drive back a different route to get home or they need to leave an hour earlier to get to their house. Maybe they need to stay later than they would have planned. Or maybe they don't want to leave. And that's ok. It doesn't have to ruin anything.\n\nAs long as everyone is included and has a say, it's all good. It doesn't mean that there won't be stress involved. There will be. I'm not going to lie. We may end up fighting about some things. Or they might leave early, which makes us upset. But at the end of the day, we're still family. We still love each other. We still get to have fun.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that sometimes, I need to let other people in. To let them have a say in what happens. Otherwise, it will just be me against them. And I'd rather be the bigger person. I'd rather be the one who says &quot;Fine, I'll do it this way&quot; instead of the one who gets in an argument.

The book is written by Jeremy Spencer, who claims that his grandfather was a cult leader and that his father was in a cult. It is hoped that by publishing this book that Jeremy Spencer can stop this cycle and prevent any other children from being hurt in this way.\n\nA spokesperson for Jeremy Spencer has confirmed that he is desperately in need of some cash to fund the marketing and promotion of the book. The cost is simply too great to risk doing it alone. He hopes that if he can raise enough money to pay for advertising, then he will be able to share his story and help people.\n\nIf Jeremy Spencer can raise enough money for the book, then he will gift it to the person who donates the most money. The donation can be made via the crowdfunding site Kickstarter.com.\n\nDonating to this crowdfunding campaign is likely to have more benefits than simply receiving a copy of the book. You can be part of the book and even get a speaking part in it. This is a great opportunity to help someone with a great story.&quot;\n\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding website that allows you to donate money to people who are trying to raise money for something. In return for your donations, you can receive gifts from the person you are donating to.\n\nWould You Accept A Ridiculously Generous Gift?\n\nA friend of mine contacted me a few months ago to ask if I would consider reviewing a book for them. The book was called Cults Inside Out and the author is called Jeremy Spencer. He has offered to donate the book to the highest bidder.\n\nCults Inside Out is the first of a trilogy and Jeremy Spencer is trying to raise money to self-publish the second book. As part of his plan, Jeremy is offering to donate the book to the highest bidder. The highest bidder is whoever donates the most money to Jeremy's GoFundMe account.\n\nWould you accept a ridiculously generous gift? I decided that I would.\n\nJeremy Spencer is an interesting character. I had never heard of him before and I was sceptical about some of the things that he had to say. Jeremy is a bit of a controversial character and he is no stranger to the press. He is very controversial and he has a history of being sued for libel, but you can find out more about that on his GoFundMe page.\n\nThe book is about cults and how they use manipulation techniques to recruit people into their organisations. The book also talks about the psychology of the cult members and how they get manipulated. There is some fascinating stuff in there and it is an easy read.\n\nThe book starts with the stories of two children who were born into cults. One child was the son of a cult leader and the other child was the daughter of another cult leader. Both children were exposed to extreme forms of cult abuse and you can really feel the pain that they went through.\n\nI didn't really enjoy reading the stories of the two children because it was so sad. You could really feel their pain. I am glad that Jeremy was able to escape the cult, but I don't think that it is an easy thing to do. There are always going to be repercussions, no matter how many years later.\n\nAfter the stories of the two children, Jeremy goes on to talk about the psychology of the cult members. I didn't realise that there were so many different reasons why people join cults. There are a number of factors that can influence the decision to join a cult.\n\nThere are a number of strategies that cults use to recruit new members and Jeremy goes on to discuss the techniques that they use. He talks about how they use manipulation and persuasion techniques to encourage people to join them. Jeremy is not the first person to talk about these strategies, but he does explain them in a very clear way.\n\nJeremy also talks about the different kinds of cults and what they are like. There are religious cults and political cults and there are even business cults. There are all kinds of cults and it is fascinating to read about how they are structured and what they are all about.\n\nJeremy Spencer has also included information about his family and his time in the cult. I have never been in a cult, so I don't know what it is like, but I was impressed with how well Jeremy handled the subject. He didn't talk about the cult in a negative way and he didn't try to make it sound worse than it was.\n\nThere is a lot of information about cults in this book and Jeremy doesn't try to overstate any of the facts. He doesn't try to talk in hyperbole and he gives very factual descriptions of what it is like to be in a cult.\n\nIf you are a fan of cults, then this book is going to be right up your street. If you are just interested in psychology, then this book is also going to be right up your street. There are a lot of interesting theories and a lot of fascinating facts.\n\nThere are a number of interesting stories and you can really feel the emotion in this book. I am glad that I have read it, but I don't think that I will read the rest of the trilogy.\n\nWhat you will get if you make the highest bid\n\nIf you make the highest bid on Jeremy's GoFundMe page, then he will send you a copy of Cults Inside Out. The money that you donate will be used to help with the marketing and promotion of the book.\n\nI have seen people donate large amounts of money to crowdfunding projects, so it is definitely possible. Jeremy is even offering to sign your copy of the book, if you make the highest bid.\n\nThe book is available in paperback and as an e-book. You will also be able to get it in various different languages. It is likely to be available in a number of different countries.\n\nYou can get a signed copy of the book for just $30 and Jeremy has been very generous with his offers. There are some very generous rewards if you can make the highest bid. Jeremy is determined to get this book out and he will give you the opportunity to help him.\n\nIf you are interested in making the highest bid, then click here.

How can you be sure she's comfortable? And what should you do if she says no?\n\nHere's how to handle your first time.\n\nGetting ready for the first time\n\nEven though your first time might be really exciting, you need to remember that having sex for the first time can be really awkward.\n\nThis is especially true if you're nervous, so to make it easier for both of you, try to relax, and make sure you're both feeling comfortable and happy to do it. You don't want to be worrying about whether your partner's enjoying it.\n\nThe best way to do this is to talk about it before you get started. Find out what she expects, and what she doesn't. Try to find out how much she knows about sex. It might seem strange to talk about this, but it will make it easier for you both when you get down to it.\n\nYou can talk about contraception too. Both of you should know how you're going to stop pregnancy happening and what to do if it does.\n\nA lot of guys worry about getting their first time over with, but in fact, the longer you take, the more you'll enjoy it. Most girls feel more comfortable the longer it takes. If you try to rush things, you're more likely to make her feel uncomfortable and she might not enjoy it.\n\nWhat if you're with someone new?\n\nIf you're having sex with someone for the first time, you may be nervous. You're not sure what to expect.\n\nYou're likely to be worried that you won't know how to do it properly or that you'll be rubbish in bed. But the fact is, it doesn't matter how good you are. All that matters is that you both enjoy it and that you're safe.\n\nYour worries might make you want to rush things and this might make you less sensitive and not as gentle as you should be. This is especially true if you're with a virgin. She'll be more nervous than you, so make sure you take your time and that you both enjoy it.\n\nYou'll know if she's enjoying it if she shows signs of pleasure, like:\n\nmoaning\n\ngetting very wet (this is the most obvious one!)\n\nshe may make noises or say things to let you know she's enjoying it\n\nremember to look for these signs!\n\nFirst time with a girl: the sex\n\nSex for the first time can be really exciting.\n\nWhat if she says no?\n\nIf your first time involves having sex with a girl, there's a chance she might say no. That's normal. It's important to make sure she's happy to do it. It's your responsibility to make sure she's okay with it and you don't want to do anything that might hurt her or make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nEven if she says yes, she might change her mind when the time comes. This can be a little awkward, especially if you've been going out with her for a while and you've had sex before.\n\nIf this happens, try to deal with it like a man. If you want to take it further, tell her you really want to, but you won't if she's not up for it.\n\nIf she wants to stop, you should respect that. It can happen, even if she's wanted to have sex for a while. If you think she might be pregnant, make sure you take care of that too.\n\nThe actual sex\n\nIt's important that you know how to please a girl, but this is especially important the first time. It will help you build your confidence, and it will also help her enjoy sex more.\n\nHow do you please a girl?\n\nWhat most people think about when it comes to pleasing a girl is what feels good for her. But in fact, what feels good for you is important too. It's the only way you can both enjoy yourselves and have a great time.\n\nBe careful to go slowly. If you go too fast, you might scare her or make her uncomfortable.\n\nWhat if you're not having sex with a virgin?\n\nIf you're not having sex with a virgin, it's unlikely that you'll have to worry about losing your virginity. It's more likely that she will lose hers!\n\nWhen you have sex for the first time, it's still important that you take it slow. It might be even more important because you'll need to show her that you can be gentle and caring. This will make sure she feels comfortable with you. It will also make sure that you have a great time too.\n\nIs she ready for sex?\n\nYou need to know when she's ready to have sex. If you rush it, you could end up doing something that she's not ready for. This could make her feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, which could make you feel embarrassed too.\n\nIf you don't think she's ready, you shouldn't go ahead. That's because it might make her feel like she's not good enough.\n\nJust be patient and make sure you're both happy and comfortable.\n\nYou can help her decide when she's ready for sex by asking her. Ask her what she thinks about having sex. If she says no, respect that, and don't push it.\n\nIf she says yes, talk about what you both think. Ask her if she's ready for it and talk about what you both expect. You'll both feel more relaxed if you know what's going to happen and you're both ready for it.\n\nDon't forget, it's important that you're both ready, not just her!\n\nWhat if you're with a virgin?\n\nSex for the first time can be really scary. But remember, you're both in the same boat and you can help each other through it.\n\nIf you're with a virgin, you need to remember that she's not an expert. It will take her a while to get used to sex and you need to give her time. It will help if you make sure you go slowly.\n\nAs you know, she'll be nervous, so you need to make sure she feels comfortable.\n\nSome girls are really confident and they're great at giving directions. But other girls aren't, so if she needs help, you should be there to help her.\n\nHow do you make sure she's ready?\n\nYou might have to talk about it. You might feel like she's pushing you into having sex, but she might not actually be ready for it.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable talking to her, you can find out by looking at her. Does she seem relaxed? Is she making the right noises? Is she happy? If she seems happy, you're probably okay.\n\nMake sure you ask her about contraception too. It's important to keep yourself safe, so make sure you both know how you're going to prevent pregnancy.\n\nWhat if you have problems?\n\nSex for the first time can be really scary for some guys. But the good news is that it doesn't have to be.\n\nWhat if you're having trouble getting an erection?\n\nIf you're having trouble getting an erection, it could be that you're nervous. It could also be that you don't feel ready for sex.\n\nIf it's nerves, you should try to relax. Try to take it slowly. You don't want to scare your partner. If you're not ready for sex, then you need to tell her.\n\nIt might help to talk to her about it first. If you think you're ready, but she isn't, you should respect that. You don't want to make her feel bad or make her regret having sex with you.\n\nIt's important that you're both ready for it and that you both feel comfortable. If you're not ready, don't go through with it.\n\nWhat if it doesn't feel right?\n\nSome guys worry about whether they're doing it right. It can be a bit scary if you don't know what to do.\n\nIt's really important that you talk about it. If you think it's not right, you should ask her.\n\nAnd don't worry too much. There's no right way to have sex. The important thing is that both of you are enjoying it and that you're both safe.\n\nIt's really important that you both make sure you're ready for sex. You don't want to go through with it if she's not ready.\n\nIf you're having sex with a virgin, then you need to be more careful. She might not know what she's doing, so it's important that you tell her what you want. You should also tell her if it doesn't feel right.\n\nWhat if it hurts?\n\nIf you're having sex for the first time, there's a chance that it could hurt. But the good news is that this should only happen the first time. If it happens again, you should get help as soon as possible.\n\nYour partner should tell you if it hurts, so you need to listen to her. You should also be able to tell if it hurts. If you can't, then it's not right.\n\nIf it hurts her, then you need to stop and think about what you're doing. It's important that you both know what feels good and what doesn't.\n\nIf you're not sure what to do, then it might be best to practice with a toy. You can use it to find out what she likes and what she doesn't.\n\n]" time="0.858"><properties><property name="score" value="0.00021400572" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Don't miss the return of the Vancouver Stars to the Coast Soccer League.

It stars Ajay Devgn and Ayesha Takia in lead roles and Kunal Khemu, Nafisa Ali and Rajpal Yadav in supporting roles. The film is a remake of the American movie &quot;Unfaithful&quot;.\n\nThis movie was an average grosser at the box office.\n\nA middle class girl, Meghna (Ayesha Takia) lives with her divorced mother, Dr. Kamla Tiwari (Reema Lagoo), a well known psychiatrist, and her younger sister in the suburbs of Mumbai. Her parents had divorced when she was just two years old, and she has hardly seen her father, Colonel Rameshwar Prasad (Deepak Shirke), ever since.\n\nRajeev Mathur (Ajay Devgn), a renowned architect, is married to Sheetal (Ayesha Julka), who is the love of Meghna's life. Meghna falls in love with Rajeev, and they become involved in an illicit relationship. One day, while trying to evade Rajeev, Meghna witnesses an incident where her father, whom she had not met for more than twelve years, is found dead at a friend's farmhouse.\n\nShe goes to his funeral and is completely shocked to see Rajeev there. On confronting him, she is told that he and her father were old friends and colleagues. She accepts this, but not before starting to suspect that Rajeev has been trying to get her out of the way in order to take over her father's position. She confronts Rajeev on this, but he insists that this is not the case.\n\nMeghna, unable to bear the thought that her father was killed, decides to investigate on her own. She tracks down one of the servants at the farmhouse, who reveals that her father was shot, and that Rajeev was there, drunk, when it happened. She confronts Rajeev, who admits that he and her father were involved in a fraud, in which they stole money from one of their clients, and faked his death to escape justice. However, Rajeev swears that he has nothing to do with her father's death.\n\nShe believes him, and accepts that she was wrong in suspecting him. While trying to console her, he kisses her. They decide to meet the next day. However, on the way to her meeting with Rajeev, she finds him being confronted by her mother and sister, who saw him leaving their house. Rajeev confesses to them that he and Meghna have been involved in a relationship, but insists that they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAfter much debate, her family decides to agree to the relationship. Rajeev insists that Meghna move in with them, but she is shocked to learn that she is pregnant with his child. She insists that Rajeev take a DNA test to prove that the child is his, and he does so.\n\nHe confesses to her that he was never married to his wife, and had no children. He had always been in love with Meghna, but had not told anyone about it, not even her father. Sheetal had left him for another man, who later divorced her, and Rajeev's father was killed by one of his clients, who then blackmailed him. He promises that they will run away together, but Meghna doesn't believe him.\n\nLater that night, Rajeev is killed, and Meghna is accused of the murder. Dr. Tiwari believes her daughter, and begins to suspect that Sheetal might be the murderer. The police refuse to believe Dr. Tiwari's story, and the family falls apart. Meghna is released, but her mother refuses to see her, and she is forced to live with her uncle and his family.\n\nWhen the child is born, the family is forced to admit that the child does bear a close resemblance to Rajeev. They forgive Meghna and re-accept her. She goes to Rajeev's mother (Nafisa Ali), and tells her that the child is Rajeev's. His mother is grief-stricken, but eventually decides to accept Meghna, and asks her to name the child, since Rajeev was also hers.

From 1853 to 1860 he attended the Shamakhy religious school, and then later at the Shamakhi Muslim Boarding School. In 1862, he studied at the Nizamiyya Madrasah in Ganja. At first, he worked as a teacher, but then he moved to Tiflis where he studied at the Caucasian Muslim Gymnasium from 1864 to 1870. Then he returned to Shamakhi and taught at his old school until 1876, when he left for Tiflis again. In 1877, he moved to Baku and worked as a deputy editor and later as an editor at the &quot;Hayat&quot; newspaper. He lived in Tiflis for a third time from 1878 to 1884, and then returned to Baku, where he established a publishing house named &quot;Abdulgaffar&quot;, which published the first Azerbaijani newspaper &quot;Bakinskiy Listok&quot;. He died in 1889.\n\nRafibeyli is considered the founder of the Azerbaijani novel. He is also the author of numerous plays. His best-known plays include &quot;Mumtaz Khan&quot; (1882), &quot;Seyid Huseyn&quot; (1886), &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot; (1884), &quot;Khanlar Bahadur&quot; (1886), and &quot;Shirin&quot; (1887). His plays mainly revolve around the heroic deeds of people in the history of Azerbaijan, but his historical plays do not have a profound philosophical content. As well as plays, he also wrote novels and short stories such as &quot;Koroghlu&quot; (1872), &quot;Xirayi&quot; (1872), &quot;Jabal&quot; (1872), &quot;Dashtadem&quot; (1873), &quot;Shah Abbas and Kamaleddin Efendi&quot; (1879), &quot;Bahadur Khan Shaku&quot; (1880), &quot;Shah Mansur&quot; (1882), &quot;Shirin&quot; (1886), &quot;Sulthan Mahmud&quot; (1888), &quot;Dervish Khudadat&quot; (1886), &quot;Agha Mammad Hasan&quot; (1888), &quot;Qataghani&quot; (1889), &quot;Khurshidbanu Natavan&quot; (1889), &quot;Nebiy&quot; (1890), &quot;Unsulli&quot; (1890), and &quot;Gulbakhor&quot; (1890).\n\nHis two most famous works are &quot;Seyid Huseyn&quot; (1886) and &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot; (1884). &quot;Seyid Huseyn&quot; was written after the Karabakh liberation movement (1830-1835) and was first staged in 1873. It is a work of realism and it depicts the life of the Azerbaijani feudal landlord Seyid Huseyn.

Hier sind dementsprechend einige russische Technologien in den vergangenen Jahren installiert worden. Vor allem Stromerzeugung von Solarzellen hat sich f\xfcr Kuba als erfolgreich erwiesen. In den vergangenen f\xfcnf Jahren wurden 2.000 Solarzellen in Kuba eingesetzt.\n\nDer Nutzen von Solarzellen f\xfcr Kuba\n\nSolarenergie f\xf6rdert auf Kuba gesundheitlich viele Vorteile. Erstens erzeugt sie Strom, was f\xfcr einen Staat, der wie Kuba so viele wichtige Schritte in Sachen Energie f\xfcr eine modernisierte Gesellschaft geht, eine gro\xdfe Rolle spielt. Die Energiegewinnung wird damit auch in Kuba demographisch ausgeglichen.\n\nZweitens l\xf6st die Sonnenenergie den direkten Nutzen f\xfcr die medizinische Versorgung aus. Das bedeutet, dass Solarzellen auch f\xfcr die Versorgung von medizinischem Ger\xe4t eingesetzt werden k\xf6nnen, wodurch wiederum die Gesundheit der Menschen verbessert wird. So gesehen ist die Installation von Solarzellen eine entscheidende Sache, die f\xfcr eine langfristige Gesundheit von Menschen gesorgt hat.\n\nWie werden Solarzellen produziert?\n\nAuch wenn das Wetter auf Kuba eine gro\xdfe Rolle spielt, kann man aufgrund der Klima\xe4nderungen auf der Insel mit einem bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Anwendung von Solarenergie rechnen. Daher werden die Solarzellen auf Kuba in gro\xdfem Umfang eingesetzt. Wie genau das im Einzelnen geschieht, zeigt das Beispiel des Leuchtturms \u201eLa Revoluci\xf3n\u201c in der Provinz Las Tunas. Dieser wurde mit Solarzellen gebaut, weil die vorhandene Infrastruktur einige Herausforderungen mit sich bringt. Die Installation der Solarzellen hat dementsprechend unmittelbare Erfolge mit sich gebracht.\n\nDer Leuchtturm befindet sich auf einer Klippe, die einen Abstand von 1.250 Metern zum Festland hat. Es gibt keine M\xf6glichkeit, in den Turm ein Stromkabel einzuziehen. Das ist deshalb ein Problem, weil dieser Turm eine gewisse Gr\xf6\xdfe hat. Die M\xf6glichkeit, dass der Strom aus der Natur umweltfreundlich gewonnen werden kann, wird durch die Installation der Solarzellen genutzt. Wie es ebenfalls erw\xe4hnt wurde, befindet sich der Leuchtturm auf einer Klippe und somit auch einige Kilometer von der Siedlung entfernt. Deshalb ist es hier sehr lohnenswert, Solarzellen zu installieren.\n\nDie gro\xdfe Stromproduktion des Leuchtturms ist das Resultat des Einsatzes von Solarenergie. Der gesamte Energiebedarf wird damit gedeckt. Solarzellen haben sich dementsprechend als eine \xe4u\xdferst wertvolle Sache f\xfcr Kuba erwiesen. Dadurch wird eine stromproduzierende Stelle sichergestellt, die unabh\xe4ngig vom Regenwetter ist. Somit haben Solarzellen einen unglaublich hohen Nutzen f\xfcr Kuba.\n\nFazit\n\nDie Installation von Solarzellen auf Kuba stellt somit einen sehr wichtigen Baustein f\xfcr das Funktionieren der Gesellschaft dar. Die Produktion von Strom aus Sonnenenergie f\xf6rdert die Gesundheit, da sie dem Bev\xf6lkerungswachstum Rechnung tr\xe4gt. Solarzellen sind daher auch in Kuba eine wichtige Sache, um die Energieversorgung zu sichern.]" time="0.324"><properties><property name="score" value="0.010673079" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Cardiac intervention in men is a critical procedure performed with the best equipment available. Sometimes, however, there are complications that are difficult to solve. For example, the images provided by a coronary angiography may not be clear enough for the doctor to determine the problem. In this situation, it is necessary to perform an intervention for coronary angioplasty. This is a technique that was introduced in the 1970s and has been improved many times over the years.\n\nWhat is coronary angioplasty?\n\nCoronary angioplasty is a technique that allows the narrowing of a coronary artery to be dilated. This is done with the use of a catheter that has a flexible balloon at its end. This is inflated and deflated so that the artery is dilated. Once the dilation is achieved, a stent is implanted to keep the artery dilated and allow blood to flow properly. The stent is a small metal ring that is placed inside the lumen of the artery. It acts as a scaffold and prevents the vessel from closing. This is important because, if this happened, the part of the heart that receives blood from this artery would not receive any more.\n\nCoronary angioplasty is performed under general anesthesia. The patient is given nitroglycerin so that the pain caused by the dilation of the artery is less intense. Sometimes, if the patient has chest pain, an injection of painkillers may be needed.\n\nAfter the procedure is completed, the patient is observed to make sure he has not had any complications. If the patient develops a hematoma, the artery is usually clamped again and the hematoma is removed by inserting a small wire.\n\nThe risk of complications is low. They can develop in patients who have had angioplasty many times or who have had previous heart attacks.\n\nThe main advantage of angioplasty is that it provides immediate relief for the patient. If the stent works well, the patient may need to take medication for the rest of his life. This is an important advantage for those who have suffered a heart attack and are at risk of a second one.\n\nIn certain cases, it is necessary to repeat the intervention several times until the lumen of the artery becomes stable. Usually, the procedure is done after 4-6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s progress.]" time="0.296"><properties><property name="score" value="0.13301806" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Olympic Champion Jazmin Carlin had a successful return to racing on the World Cup circuit this weekend, winning a silver medal in the 50m backstroke and claiming two more top-3 finishes in the 200m individual medley and 50m freestyle.\n\nCarlin, a Manchester born-and-bred athlete who moved to Wales to train with the Welsh Academy, produced a stunning performance in the 50m backstroke, finishing just over a second behind American world-record holder Kathleen Baker.\n\nA week earlier she had set a new British record of 26.06 seconds at the British Championships, setting up a superb start to the 2018 season.\n\nEarlier in the week, Carlin also clocked a lifetime best in the 200m individual medley in Glasgow.

His life there became the basis of a plantation diary written by Francis Le Jau in 1741. The diary and other documents were later published as &quot;The Journal of Francis Le Jau, 1741\u20131743&quot;, by Richard Hakluyt (the pseudonym of a 19th-century English writer). In the document Marocs and his fellow slaves are described as being part of the possessions of Captain Francisco Menendez M\xe1rquez, who died and willed them to his nephew Captain Don Jose Men\xe9ndez M\xe1rquez. \n\nAt the time of Le Jau's journal, Marocs had become a trusted member of the household, handling business transactions on the plantation. On August 5, 1742, he signed a contract of manumission with Captain Don Jose Men\xe9ndez M\xe1rquez. He became a free man, and was set up with a farm and a lifetime income, in exchange for his work as a steward on the plantation.\n\nSome time later, he was accused of killing a slave of his neighbour, Charles de Sauvinet. Marocs was sent to St. Augustine for trial, but was acquitted due to a lack of evidence. The local Spanish governor and slave owners took Marocs' acquittal as an insult, and made him wear an iron collar to publicly declare his guilt. The collar was fastened with an iron chain and ring around his neck and he was locked to the wall of the courthouse. Marocs would stay in St. Augustine for the next 12 years until the colonial government collapsed during the American Revolution.\n\nMarocs became a symbol of African resistance and a rallying cry for slaves during the Stono Rebellion of September 9, 1739. The rebellion of slaves and African free men, planned and carried out by a slave named Jemmy, began with an armed group of about twenty men killing two British traders. They marched south to the St. Augustine Parish church, where they broke into the weapons store. They then broke into the house of the militia leader, Lieutenant Governor William Bull. After killing him, the rebels marched to the St. Johns River, where they seized boats and rowed to freedom across the Santee River into the interior of South Carolina. There were 60 or so participants in the revolt, with 40 of them escaping and the rest either killed or captured. The colonial militia and British Army killed many of the captured rebels.\n\nThe Stono rebellion started a series of revolts in the British colonies. The revolt started the movement to end the slave trade and slavery in the Thirteen Colonies and led to the declaration of independence by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.\n\n\n]" time="0.728"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.0&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.0

It is time to push back.\n\nWhile the politicians involved in the passage of the 2013 farm bill have been lionized for their actions, it was actually the members of the grassroots, the vast majority of whom are not farm owners, that saved the farm bill.\n\nAlthough the House of Representatives only received a 5 percent score from the AFBF, according to the FMI\u2019s own scorecard, a significantly larger number of lawmakers voted with the FMI\u2019s policy recommendations when it came time to actually cast a vote on the 2013 farm bill. That is a big difference, one that makes the distinction between the union\u2019s demonization of farmers and the reality of farmers\u2019 lives crystal clear.\n\nSome of the most vocal advocates of farmers in the media are organizations and individuals that are largely funded by the food stamp program. The same groups pushing to expand food stamps are lobbying for higher farm prices. Their message is confusing, even contradictory, and it simply does not resonate with voters.\n\nThe farm bill was also a big winner for consumers. The American Farm Bureau\u2019s own report, which tracks consumer prices, found that the price of fresh fruits and vegetables fell by more than 9 percent in 2013. Americans may not like to think of farmers as price makers, but there is no question that low commodity prices resulted in lower prices for consumers.\n\nAs the current farm bill continues through the process, and in anticipation of the 2014 midterm elections, we need to make sure that the politicians we elect are being held accountable for the actual impacts of the farm bill.\n\nNo amount of lobbying is going to influence the farm bill debate if it is going to be followed by groups that are financed by the food stamp program.

I still have the book (even though it\u2019s really old and falling apart) and I\u2019ve read it numerous times. I can\u2019t get enough of Gus and Woodrow, and Captain Call. And I adore their \u201cwomen,\u201d Clara and Newt. I will recommend this book to anyone and everyone that I meet, and I love it so much I will probably read it again.\n\n2. Swimming to Catalina \u2013 Lynn Hall\n\nI found this book when I was at a thrift store on vacation. I was looking for a romance novel because they are my favorite books to read. I just can\u2019t get enough of them. But I was shocked to find that this book was a romance book written by a man. It was a romance book in the style of a mystery. I have never read a book like it and I loved every minute of it. The characters are quirky and interesting and the romance is off the charts.\n\n3. How to Lose Friends and Alienate People \u2013 Toby Young\n\nThis book was one of my favorite reads last year. I knew the story of this guy, Toby Young, already. I\u2019ve watched him on television and I\u2019ve read some of his books. This one wasn\u2019t a very happy read, though. In it, he details his misadventures with the British press and his life in New York City. The book was extremely funny, but there were also some very serious parts of the story. Toby is a character that I am sure I\u2019ll be reading about for years to come.\n\n4. Lonesome Dove \u2013 Robert James Waller\n\nI read this book after reading Larry McMurty\u2019s, but it was a completely different story. In this version, the two main characters are a man and a woman, and they are in their fifties. They decide to drive their herd of cattle across Texas to Montana. As they go on their journey they have many adventures, some are funny, some are serious. The romance between the two main characters was extremely interesting to read about. The last time I read it I was only twelve, so I had no idea what was going on. But I still loved it and I would read it again.\n\n5. The Chocolate War \u2013 Robert Cormier\n\nThis is another book that I\u2019ve read multiple times, but I will read it again. The story is about a boy who lives at a Catholic school. His mother has recently died and he is being picked on by the school bully. He begins a \u201cconfrontation\u201d with the bully by refusing to sell chocolates on the first day of school. After this, he is forced to join a secret organization at the school and he becomes involved in a lot of dangerous situations. This is one of the books that I recommend to most people, I think. It\u2019s not my favorite, but it\u2019s worth a read.\n\nAnd there you have it! The five books that I am recommending to you today. I hope that you enjoy them as much as I did!\n\nAdvertisements]" time="0.306"><properties><property name="score" value="0.5426594" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[San Francisco 49ers Tickets\n\nSan Francisco 49ers News\n\nSan Francisco 49ers Tickets\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are one of the most storied teams in all of football, the 49ers were one of the original teams in the NFL when they joined the NFL in 1950. At that time they were called the San Francisco Forty-Niners, a name that actually came from a fan who thought it would be a cool name. The 49ers original colors were red and gold and their logo was a little man in a red hat on top of a gold football. Those colors and the team name stuck with the 49ers for the next twenty-two years, but when the team moved to the Bay area they decided to make some changes. First they changed their team colors from red and gold to red, white, and blue. They also changed their logo to a flag that showed their new colors, and the man in the red hat was replaced with a miner from the mining days in the Bay area. Those changes stuck with the 49ers for almost thirty years, but when they moved to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California they decided it was time for another change. The Niners kept the same colors, but changed the logo to a more updated version of the old one. The miner was replaced by a red oval with the SF logo in the middle of it, and the new oval was inside a white oval, with a gold border around it.The 49ers were one of the founding members of the NFL, and they made their first playoff appearance in 1957, but did not win their first playoff game until 1982. Even with the bad records the Niners were one of the most well-known teams in the NFL. The Niners were the first NFL team to win five Super Bowl titles, and were named the team of the decade for the 1980s. Even with all of their success the Niners were in the cellar of the NFC West for many years, and that is why they had such a hard time making it to the playoffs. They had a couple of playoff runs in the 2000s, but they have not been to the Super Bowl since 1994.The Niners have made it to the Super Bowl five times, and they won five Super Bowls in the 1980s. They were the team of the decade for the 1980s, and their greatest coach was the legendary Bill Walsh. In the early years of the Niners the team was led by quarterbacks Joe Montana and Steve Young, but they could not get over the hump and make it to the Super Bowl. In the early nineties the Niners picked up a quarterback by the name of Steve Young and he became the greatest quarterback to ever wear the red and white. Young won the MVP award twice, and made it to six Pro Bowls before his career was cut short by an injury. The Niners were also led by running backs Joe Montana and Roger Craig, and wide receivers Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens. The Niners had the most dominant defense in football in the 1980s, and their success has not been matched since then.]" time="0.471"><properties><property name="score" value="0.02722148"

A recent report by Kelley Blue Book indicates that sales of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) are gaining market share. As a result, Tesla is poised to benefit from the EV revolution.\n\nSource:Kelley Blue Book\n\nSales of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) have grown significantly from 2011 to 2013. In that span, the EV market share increased from .33 percent to 1.4 percent. Moreover, Kelley Blue Book predicts that EVs could account for 4 percent of new car sales in the US by 2020.\n\nTesla Motors is also poised to capitalize on this trend. The company is highly regarded as a leader in the EV market. Tesla\u2019s Model S was named Motor Trend\u2019s 2013 \u201cCar of the Year\u201d and was the Consumer Reports top rated EV of 2013.\n\nModel S sales are expected to increase significantly in 2014 as Tesla is rolling out more affordable models. Tesla is also benefiting from the increased supply of lithium-ion batteries. According to Lux Research, the EV market is growing at an average of 21.6 percent per year and is expected to grow to $7.5 billion in 2020.\n\nSource: Lux Research\n\nDespite these positive developments, Tesla shorts continue to prevail. Despite the gains in the stock price, Tesla shorts are sticking to their bearish bets. Tesla shorts have bet against the company for over three years. Currently, there are 35 million Tesla shares that are sold short, and the shorts are holding on to the shares despite the rebound in the stock price.\n\nSource:Bloomberg\n\nThe recent gains in the stock price have not been enough to satisfy short sellers. More than 27 million shares were sold short in the first quarter of 2014 alone. Tesla shorts are also comfortable with shorting the company at its current valuation.\n\nWith the current short interest, Tesla shorts could be forced to close their short positions by the end of the second quarter. However, some Tesla shorts could still be holding on to their positions despite the closing of the shorting window.\n\nIn the meantime, Tesla continues to deliver on its promises. The company continues to roll out its new product lines, and it is also opening new Tesla stores around the world.\n\nTesla shares continue to be a favorite short among hedge funds. According to FactSet, the shares are one of the most shorted companies in the S&amp;P 500. Tesla short interest is more than three times higher than that of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and about five times higher than that of Ford Motor (NYSE:F).\n\nGeneral Motors short interest as of 04/02/2014\n\nFord Motor short interest as of 04/02/2014\n\nDespite the record short interest, Tesla is going from strength to strength. The company is expanding its product line, and it is well on its way to dominate the EV market. Additionally, the company has surpassed its 2014 production targets.

The Bulldogs won, 78-59. (Photo: AP)\n\nThe always-lively discussion of the NCAA Tournament selection committee's biggest and best blunders (which usually is a list of blunders) has been further fueled by a freshman who's now in the mix for being one of the biggest and best picks of the first round in Thursday night's draft.\n\nAnd by all accounts, Gonzaga's Zach Collins was, in fact, one of the biggest and best players in the nation this past season.\n\nDarn it, somebody in the official outfit that has the Final Four placements, the brackets and the selections did a superb job in providing a team that was vastly superior to a top-10 team with a second chance to participate in a college basketball tournament.\n\nZach Collins, a 7-foot, 230-pound center from Las Vegas, was the team's third-leading scorer this past season, behind Przemek Karnowski and point guard Nigel Williams-Goss.\n\nBuy Photo University of Nevada head basketball coach Eric Musselman coaches during the second half of his team's NCAA basketball game against the Boise State Broncos at Lawlor Events Center in Reno on Thursday, February 16, 2017.

Smedes/Special to the RGJ)\n\nCollins was instrumental in Gonzaga's winning the West Coast Conference tournament and advancing to the Elite Eight. He scored 20 points in the first half in the opening-round win over Texas Southern, and that was one of the top performances in the tourney.\n\nCollins is slated as a lottery pick in the draft. His brother, 6-9-180 center John Collins of Wake Forest, also is in the mix as a first-round pick.\n\nHere's the thing: What if Collins had chosen to play for the Wolf Pack this past season? The WCC would have been a little bit better. The Zags would have been less impressive.\n\nHe would have played in the Mountain West, and in most cases, there was not a huge discrepancy between the Mountain West and the WCC in the 2016-17 season. In the first seven games of the season, Nevada won five times, which was nearly identical to the Zags' win total over the same period.\n\nFor the season, Gonzaga was 33-2, and Nevada was 28-7. The Zags played in the NCAA Tournament. The Wolf Pack didn't.\n\nWas Collins a first-round pick in that alternate reality? Probably not, but there's a good chance he would have been drafted, and it would have been by one of the NBA teams that had an interest in him.\n\nWilliams-Goss decided to transfer to Gonzaga from Washington, but had he stayed in Seattle, Collins would have been recruited by the Huskies. In the end, it may have been a long shot that Collins would have accepted the scholarship, but then again, who knew he would be such a talent?\n\nBut, maybe Collins did decide to play for the Wolf Pack, and then maybe Williams-Goss stayed in Seattle. And then maybe Collins and Williams-Goss played against each other for the championship of the Mountain West in 2016-17, and maybe it would have been a game for the ages.\n\nCollins, who averaged 10.0 points and 5.9 rebounds for the Zags, and Williams-Goss, who averaged 17.7 points and 6.0 assists, were both vital to the outcome of that hypothetical contest.\n\nAnd it may have gone down as one of the best games in league history.

in town, but both of these types of games have grown stale to me. I feel a lot of that is due to having seen the pattern so often that I know when the surprises are coming. I have not played Final Fantasy XII yet but I have no reason to think that this one is going to be any different. The only thing I can say that would be new is that the maps are going to be quite large. And even that is starting to feel more like a gimmick and less like something that adds to the game play. If it weren't for this system, I wouldn't be able to enjoy these games.\n\n\n\nWhile this system isn't perfect, it's better than the way it was in FFX. This system allows you to do things without being tied to one person or just your party. If I had any complaint, it would be that you still have to level up.\n\n\n\nAlso, a lot of people are saying that it will be more like X. While I agree that it's a lot like X, it's also much like X-2. That is, you get a new license board to progress the characters. You're given more freedom to change up your party and strategy. You have a lot of new abilities for the characters to use.\n\n\n\nI actually really enjoy both of these games. As far as I'm concerned, it's a toss up between X and XII. Either game would have been fine to be the last game in the series. I don't think there was a bad choice between the two. If there is one difference between the two, it's that XII is a lot more fast paced. I don't feel the need to grind as much in XII. Also, I like that you get more character development in XII.\n\n\n\nI just don't see the problem with having more than one person telling you what to do. It just depends on the story as to who it will be. It's not going to be every single person you meet. And if you have so much dialogue with everyone you meet, the game would become boring really fast.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to say if the game is going to be good or not. I'm not going to complain if it isn't, though. The game is out of Nomura's hands and even if it is a bit different from the previous games, that doesn't mean it's bad.]" time="0.285"><properties><property name="score" value="0.010504046" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[\n\nTags\n\nBack to list of posts\n\nThe reason for this is that in this kind of market, you don't want to be in an equity investment. You want to be in safe securities which don't fluctuate too much. Like CDs. If you keep a fixed amount of money in a CD and the interest rate stays constant (or goes up), you know that your fixed amount is not going to fluctuate in value by too much.So, to start, let's think about some long term goals that you have. What do you want to do 5 years from now? 10 years? 20 years? Where would you like to be financially? Have you set some specific goals for yourself?This is my story. In the meantime I will be working on getting that monkey off my back and regaining control of my life. Its very hard and as Ive said before, very humbling. Im not a perfect person. But I am a person with potential. I know this for a fact because I have seen my potential and I have achieved it. And now I have this debt and it has me worried and scared. I have my heart set on purchasing a house in the near future and I know that this has to happen for that to happen.When people are looking for financial advice they usually get a lot of conflicting information. Some may even suggest that they put all of their money into gold and that is the best place to put it. However, if you are looking to learn more about gold and where the best places are to invest your money, you need to keep reading. And with the Olympics out of the way, I'd like to know, where does the free market lead us now. Something like a new commercialization of Olympism. Something much more like the Great Global Gladiators' Track &amp; Field Stadia Circus. Something a little more like the Disneyworld of the future. Or maybe, something a little more like the planet Saturn. Possibly more like the Cold War, played out to the bitter end.I've been through some very rough times in the last two years. I have lost my father to cancer and I have lost my best friend to financial troubles. I've also spent the last two years unemployed. I worked for several months to earn money to pay for my wedding. But shortly after I was married, I lost my job. Then my husband lost his job. And our financial situation really started going downhill. I knew I needed to take control of the situation and I knew I needed to do it fast.I started by looking for a second job. I found one working in a local deli, but it didn't pay much. We cut back on our expenses as much as we could. We also looked into some debt management programs. Unfortunately, none of the debt management programs I looked at seemed to work for our situation. They all wanted us to sign up for a 3 or 5 year program and our creditors were so aggressive that it didn't seem like that would be a good idea.So I went looking for financial advice. I found a website that gave me some really great ideas about how to pay off our debt. They suggested the debt snowball technique. With the debt snowball technique you start paying off the debts with the lowest balances. You pay as much as you can on these debts each month and you throw every extra penny you can at them. As these debts get paid off, you roll the money that you were using to pay off those debts into the next highest balance debt. This helps to increase your debt payoff each month and really gets things moving in the right direction.The debt snowball technique worked great for us. We got the money we needed to pay off our debts and we didn't have to make any sacrifices at all. I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with debt. It can really work great for you if you can find the extra money to throw at your debts.It's a good question, because it's a hard question to answer. If you are very motivated to make a lot of money fast, I'd recommend you go with your passion. You are likely to enjoy it more, and as a result you will work hard to make it happen. A related question that people often ask is, &quot;What is the best industry to start a business?&quot; I recommend that you start by picking an industry you enjoy, rather than trying to find the &quot;best&quot; industry.I believe the hardest part is getting a home business started. If you are new to internet marketing, you probably don't have a large following yet. Your best chance of succeeding is by offering people some sort of freebie. If you can get enough people to follow you, you can begin to make money.]" time="0.449"><properties><property name="score" value="0.04557331" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[[SI-LIST] Re: Some more responses on DAI\n\nI just got my FPGA design up and running and I'm not sure what is\n\nwrong.

If I put the 3.3v up and the pull the bus low (no connect on the\n\nPCI pins) the bus doesn't work.\n\n\n\nThe reason I'm going for this is because I have a great PCI\n\nbridge design that I want to use and I don't want to re-implement\n\nit.\n\n\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nRyan Kahl\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe best anti-spam money can buy.

Here are a few answers, so that we can hopefully help others. Richard Sheppard wrote:&gt;&gt; 1. Can a single DAI be used for different data rates? I'm not&gt;&gt; familiar with the internal functioning of DAI, but would imagine that&gt;&gt; each must be configured for the speed of the channel, so if there is&gt;&gt; not a configurable counter or similar, then a new DAI would be needed for&gt;&gt; each data rate.&gt;&gt; 2. Would it be correct to think of a DAI as similar to a multi-mode&gt;&gt; switch, where each channel has it's own connection, but they all share the&gt;&gt; same switch? The switching will be done at the channel driver, or&gt;&gt; is it done at the DAI?&gt; Richard,&gt; A single DAI can be used for different data rates, but it will only have&gt; one speed wire in and one speed wire out. A multi-mode DAI will need&gt; a speed wire in and a speed wire out for each speed supported.&gt; The original spec for the DAI specified the speed wires. These were&gt; always at the channel driver level, which is why I think the original&gt; spec doesn't say anything about high impedance.

She has a busy schedule as a royal and still finds time to make the world a better place, and that includes doing her best to break down gender roles in the monarchy and challenge perceptions of what it means to be a royal bride.\n\n\n\nWhile she has been criticized by some for the way she dresses, she\u2019s also done her part to change the way royal brides have traditionally looked in the past, as well as the types of charitable efforts they\u2019ve participated in to promote their causes.\n\n\n\nMeghan\u2019s influence is evident in the family as it adapts to the more progressive changes that she brings to the monarchy. She\u2019s done everything from change her last name to start a new royal legacy and represent women\u2019s right to equality, to giving a voice to the marginalized through her various charitable causes.\n\n\n\nIn the spirit of changing the royal narrative, let\u2019s take a look at some of the ways Meghan has broken the mold as a royal bride, and what that means for the future of the monarchy.\n\n\n\n1. Using her platform to make a change\n\nMeghan\u2019s position as the Duchess of Sussex gives her a unique platform that allows her to promote causes she cares about, from racial equality to gender equality to her favorite charities. She\u2019s used that platform to make a difference for women and girls.\n\n\n\n2. Being the face of the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements\n\nShe was the first royal to speak out about the #MeToo movement, the backlash against women speaking out about sexual harassment and abuse, and what she calls the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of being a woman in the public eye. In a rare interview with the BBC, she spoke about how she\u2019s always been aware of how sexism and racism have been barriers that she had to overcome, and that she is pleased to see the MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements making their mark on society and the public at large.\n\n\n\n3. Standing by her husband during the #MeToo movement\n\nShe made a conscious decision not to speak out about the backlash against her husband\u2019s former girlfriends, like her rumored rival Meghan Markle, as she has refused to criticize other women. She doesn\u2019t play the victim, but instead encourages women to speak out against abuse and fight for equality in every aspect of their lives.\n\n\n\n4. Becoming a philanthropist and charity ambassador\n\nShe\u2019s been an ambassador for the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) since the beginning of 2018. She promotes their various projects, including the fight against the water crisis in East Africa, and the importance of providing women and children with safe drinking water and adequate sanitation services.\n\n\n\n5. The fashion choices she makes as a royal bride\n\nWhile Meghan is often criticized for her outfits and looks by members of the public, she\u2019s broken a few rules and worn clothes that had never been worn by previous royal brides. She\u2019s broken the tradition of a royal bride wearing all white by wearing a black pantsuit by Stella McCartney to her wedding. She\u2019s also chosen a number of different designers for her wedding gowns, and has worn outfits that are a little more modern in their style.\n\n\n\n6. As a role model for women and girls\n\nMeghan has made it clear that she wants to use her influence to promote the idea that women and girls can do and be anything, including princesses. She\u2019s spoken openly about the obstacles she faced as a biracial woman in America and has spoken about how her mother taught her to be strong, to never give up, and to push through any obstacles.\n\n\n\n7. Using her fame to help women in other countries\n\nShe\u2019s spoken about how the public should be \u201cmindful\u201d of women in other countries when they\u2019re giving out opinions and criticisms about women and their clothing. She wants to ensure that women from different cultures are able to make decisions for themselves about what they wear and how they present themselves to the world.\n\n\n\n8. Embracing and changing royal tradition\n\nShe\u2019s already had two official residences as a royal wife, making it clear that she\u2019s going to have her own role and position in the monarchy. She\u2019s also kept her maiden name and made it clear that she won\u2019t be taking the traditional route for royal brides by doing so. She\u2019s already used her influence to change royal tradition and make it more inclusive for women, as well as to make her own path in the monarchy.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Meghan has made it her mission to challenge the perception of what it means to be a royal bride, and change the way that the monarchy interacts with the public. She\u2019s already taken steps to set herself apart from other royal brides and has broken the mold in so many ways that future royal brides are sure to look to her as a role model.]" time="0.296"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0134063625" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01340636&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01340636

It was found that addition of RCA in TEMPO-O/HTP systems greatly affected the color change of the color reagent (CRC) to orange-brown, and the color intensity varied with the concentration of Na. Increasing the concentration of RCA in the system was found to affect the nature of the color change; whereas, when RCA was present at low concentration (0.01 mmol/L), it induced the color to change from orange-brown to pink-red at pH 2.5, but caused a second change in color from pink-red to dark brown-black at pH 9.5. In contrast, when RCA was present at high concentration (0.1 mmol/L), it induced the color change from orange-brown to dark brown-black at pH 2.5, and from orange-brown to red at pH 9.5. It was also found that RCA increased the rate of TEMPO reduction in the absence of HTP, and the redox peaks at +0.53 V and +0.25 V could be observed in the 1H NMR spectra of the RCAT system. The ability of RCA to function as a redox mediator for HTP reduction is important in controlling the color of the CRC system, and can be used as a promising approach to develop novel colorimetric assay systems.

This condition can occur at any age and is characterized by red, itchy rashes that often become raw and develop a crusting appearance. Treatment typically involves the application of a topical cream, with limited success. Often, the rash does not respond to the cream or appears again the next time the baby wears a diaper. When this occurs, the diaper dermatitis is typically caused by a product in the baby's diet, such as a food or a topical cream.\n\nIf you have tried all kinds of different creams, but are still dealing with a diaper rash, it is possible that the rash is not caused by a diaper. Instead, it could be caused by a food allergy or an allergy to a topical cream. Both of these allergies can present as an irritating rash on the baby's diaper area.

It is located between Massachusetts Avenue and Garden Street, and Brattle Street and JFK Street. The park is home to many monuments and statues including the George Washington Monument and the Daniel Chester French statues of Paul Revere and Robert Gould Shaw.\n\nThe Common was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965. It is part of the Boston National Historical Park.\n\nAccording to the City of Cambridge, the Common &quot;evokes the birth of American Democracy.&quot; The Common was used by the first settlers of Boston as a grazing pasture for cattle and livestock, but became a Town Common after the Town of Cambridge was created in 1630. The City of Cambridge states that, &quot;The Common was used for military drilling and mustering during the 17th and 18th centuries, and the militia members were occasionally quartered on the Common.&quot; It was used as a camp by the British before the American Revolutionary War began in 1775.\n\nA detailed history of the Cambridge Common can be found at the Cambridge Common Historical Society.\n\nA map of the Revolutionary War Battle of Cambridge shows the disposition of the troops and how they moved to various positions. The common was used as a camp ground during the Siege of Boston and as a muster ground in 1775, as well as for training and drilling. The British had guns placed on it, and during the battle it was used by both sides.\n\nGeorge Washington's first headquarters were near the Common at the John Vassall House, which stood in what is now Harvard Yard. He moved his headquarters to less exposed quarters across the Charles River in October 1775.\n\nThe Common is also home to a memorial honoring General Abner Doubleday, who is erroneously credited with inventing baseball. The memorial is a statue of Doubleday in front of the Doubleday Field gate to the common. It is one of two such statues, the other being in Cooperstown, New York. Doubleday was in fact a lifelong baseball fan who may have been involved in developing the game while a cadet at West Point, but he did not actually invent the game.\n\nThe main area of the Common is a flat, grassy field interspersed with trees, with a small, man-made lake in the center. Along its borders are brick sidewalks. Two 18-hole disc golf courses were installed in 1981, and two more in 1988. The latter two are technically on the Cambridge Common Golf Course, an adjacent parcel of land in Belmont that was purchased by the city in the 1980s, where the former driving range was converted into a grass field surrounded by trees, and where two 18-hole courses were built. The National Park Service states that &quot;The Common, as well as the eighteenth century Bow and Arrow and original disc golf courses are accessible and used for passive recreation from dawn to dusk, daily.&quot;\n\nThe Common is the site of several statues and memorials, most prominently the Civil War Memorial Grove, which features the Civil War Memorial and a monument to General George S. Patton, Sr. who was from Cambridge and a former U.S. Congressman, and a statue of George Washington.\n\nThere is also a memorial to Ephraim Gerrish, one of the first to die in the American Revolutionary War. There is a monument to local soldiers who have fallen in the Iraq War. The stone monument is in the shape of a star, and the name of the fallen is inscribed on the star's points.\n\nA statue of Civil War general Robert Gould Shaw, sculpted by Daniel Chester French and Augustus St. Gaudens, stands on the Common as part of the Shaw Memorial. The memorial was originally located on nearby Boston Common but was moved to the Cambridge Common in 1904 to allow access by more people, and is one of the first monuments to an African American. The second statue, depicting Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe with a young student, is located in the nearby Simches Corner section of the Boston Public Garden, a short walk from the main Common. Howe is best known as the co-founder of the Perkins School for the Blind, and the statue is a popular destination for school field trips.\n\nThe &quot;Civil War Memorial&quot; on the Common was completed in 1872. It was designed by Henry Howard, architect of the famed Memorial Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts. The memorial was partially paid for by George Washington Gould, a local resident who made his fortune in California gold fields. The granite obelisk is tall and is the second largest granite monument in the United States, surpassed only by the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. Its inscription reads &quot;Erected in Memory of the Soldiers from Cambridge Who Fought For the Union in the War of 1861-1865.&quot;\n\nThere is a small plaque next to the monument listing the names of the men from Cambridge who fought in the war. The bronze statue of a Civil War infantryman located next to the monument was designed by Augustus Lukeman and cast in 1874.\n\nIn 2004, the monument was restored and renovated by a group of local volunteers. The restoration included sandblasting the obelisk, repairing the granite, and repainting the soldier. A new monument, which also listed the names of soldiers from Cambridge who died in the Vietnam War, was added to the memorial. The Civil War Memorial, along with the Paul Revere Memorial, is one of the first two structures in Massachusetts to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe central water feature in the park is the &quot;Polar Bear Plunge,&quot; a fountain that is operational from April through October, which was built in 1967. This is located in front of the the main library. There is also a fountain that is off in a small gazebo to the west.\n\nThe &quot;Col. George Armistead Monument&quot; was dedicated on the Cambridge Common on September 17, 1872. It was donated by the Grand Army of the Republic. The Monument commemorates Col. Armistead who was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 3, 1863. He was carried from the field and taken to Cambridge. After his recovery he returned to duty in 1864. His death occurred in 1895.

My argument was essentially that the Super Bowl has been set up for a possible matchup between two of the greatest quarterbacks of all time in Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, and since neither of those guys will be participating in the playoffs, the Super Bowl will lose much of its luster.\n\nThe post was titled, \u201cWhy the NFL is a failure this season,\u201d and it was the first post I ever wrote for this site. Now, I\u2019m back again, and this time, I\u2019m not trying to be negative at all.\n\nNot in the least.\n\nI am simply using the same outline as before to explain how I think the NFL has gotten it right this season, from start to finish. It\u2019s simply that there are some unique circumstances surrounding the upcoming season that make it much better than usual.\n\nHere\u2019s the original post, if you missed it.\n\nHere\u2019s my new one.\n\nHow the NFL Is Doing It Right\n\n\u201cWhat is right is always on the side of the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Wilde\n\nThe NFL, as an organization, has made some questionable decisions this season. A prime example of this is the handling of the Bountygate scandal, where the Saints organization was accused of offering cash incentives for vicious hits. The NFL should have punished the organization much more harshly, but they ended up settling for an ill-advised one-year suspension of head coach Sean Payton, a six-game suspension for Saints\u2019 defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, and the loss of second-round draft picks in 2013 and 2014. This punishment was, in my opinion, much too light for such a heinous act, but it seems as though the league is finally cracking down on violent, illegal play.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the term \u201cDeflategate\u201d going around lately. As I\u2019m sure you know, this is a slang term for the controversy surrounding the pressure in the footballs used during the AFC Championship game between the Patriots and Colts. The NFL is now investigating this issue to determine whether or not the Patriots tampered with the footballs, or if they were simply deflated by other means. If they did indeed tamper with the balls, it\u2019s possible that the Patriots could be stripped of the win, and lose draft picks as well.\n\nThese are just two examples of the NFL doing something wrong this season, but they are both minor, compared to all the things they have done right. For instance, this is the first season since 1970 that has featured a team that had gone undefeated for the season. The league has never had a repeat champion since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970, and this season, that has already been changed. The Broncos have won the Super Bowl, so they have now become the first team to ever repeat as champs.\n\nAnother reason why the NFL has done it right this season is that it has followed the trend of unpredictability. For instance, there is a common misconception that the AFC is a better conference than the NFC, and that it\u2019s easier to win games in the AFC than in the NFC. However, this season, this was not the case. The NFC was the conference with the most wins, and of the five teams with the best records, three of them were NFC teams. It\u2019s safe to say that the NFC was the better conference this season.\n\nIt seems as though the NFL has followed the trend of unpredictability, not only by having a weaker conference beat a stronger conference (see the Broncos vs. the Panthers), but also by allowing lesser teams to rise to the top. The best example of this is the Kansas City Chiefs. As I am sure you know, the Chiefs are the only team in NFL history to start a season 9-0, and then finish it 1-5. They ended up with the worst record in the AFC West, and they didn\u2019t even win a single divisional game. This unpredictability is also evidenced by the fact that the Patriots were not one of the teams to make it to the playoffs.\n\nAnother reason why the NFL has done it right this season is the overall unpredictability of the playoffs. When looking at this season\u2019s playoffs, there are many different storylines, and each of them is interesting to look at. The three wild card teams in the NFC all have very good quarterbacks. The two divisional games have three great quarterbacks. The three conference championship games have one of the greatest quarterbacks ever, Peyton Manning, and two of the greatest quarterbacks ever, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.\n\nWhile the Super Bowl is more predictable, there are still plenty of storylines in that game as well. Peyton Manning has been the story of the season. He is on track to become the most prolific quarterback in NFL history, and it would be great for him to get his second Super Bowl title. The last time he won a Super Bowl, the NFL was not as popular as it is now, and it would be a good way to end his career. The other storyline is the attempt by Seattle to get back to the Super Bowl. As I wrote earlier, the Super Bowl will be more interesting this season if the Seahawks and Broncos are playing in it, because both teams have very good quarterbacks.\n\nHow could you not be excited about a game that will have three of the top ten quarterbacks in the NFL, and possibly the greatest quarterback of all time?\n\nIn addition to these storylines, there are plenty of other things that make the NFL\u2019s current situation look better. The most obvious one is that Peyton Manning\u2019s career is at an end.

Porter's latest album, Take Me to the Alley, opens with a moody version of &quot;Tears in Heaven,&quot; the Eric Clapton ballad that went to No. 1 in the U.K. in the wake of the guitarist's son's tragic death. In the studio, Porter reworks the tune with the help of Branford Marsalis. But even without the celebrated saxophonist, Porter pulls off the challenging ballad with incredible ease, and the results are, like so much of his music, brilliant.\n\nPorter's grasp of standards is no surprise. Born in California, the jazzman is the product of a mixed marriage \u2014 his father is African-American and his mother is a Chinese immigrant from Hong Kong. As a boy, Porter learned to love jazz by listening to his father's records of saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. and trumpeter Donald Byrd. He began his singing career with gospel music, however, and it wasn't until the singer's late 20s that he began to study jazz.\n\nAfter an apprenticeship in local San Francisco clubs, Porter moved to the East Coast, where he became the star of the jazz festival circuit. He released his debut album, Water, in 2012. That record, too, was front-loaded with several covers, including Bill Withers' &quot;Ain't No Sunshine.&quot; The song won him a Grammy for best Jazz Vocal Album.\n\nPorter's latest release, Take Me to the Alley, follows in the same footsteps. The album is named for a Harlem club where the performer was discovered by a fellow club-goer. Like the standard version of &quot;Tears in Heaven,&quot; the record's first track, &quot;Don't Lose Your Steam,&quot; is the kind of song that Porter can and does make his own. But Take Me to the Alley is also notable for its inclusion of original material. &quot;I'm Nobody&quot; is the title track, and it's a heartbreaking song of resignation: &quot;I'm nobody / Nobody but me.&quot; &quot;Elias&quot; tells the story of the biblical prophet in a way that's simultaneously soothing and haunting.\n\nIt's not all jazz on the new record. Porter delivers two great pop tracks, singing with restraint and sophistication on covers of Bob Marley's &quot;Is This Love&quot; and Roy Ayers' &quot;Everybody Loves the Sunshine.&quot; But those songs don't necessarily fit into the album's theme, which is built around Porter's exploration of his own spiritual experience.\n\nPorter doesn't sing of God or the devil, but rather of a longing for peace, which he finds, again and again, in the power of singing.

In today\u2019s analysis, I\u2019m going to look at the best first episodes of the season. Before we begin, I want to note that these rankings are based on the first episode only. It does not take into account the series as a whole. Let\u2019s get started!\n\n10. Kiznaiver\n\nKiznaiver has a great premise: what happens when you are forced to share pain? The series opens with a car crash scene that looks like it\u2019s going to be the whole episode, but quickly evolves into a brutal game of betrayal and pain. It\u2019s emotionally exhausting and does a great job of laying the groundwork for what is to come.\n\n9. Joker Game\n\nThe most forgettable show on this list. The opening scene, involving a rescue operation in Germany, is visually stunning, but it\u2019s not really what the rest of the series is about. Instead, the main characters are slowly introduced and while that\u2019s exciting, it doesn\u2019t really have much payoff. I would have liked more mission stuff, but I have a feeling the show is going to go the route of a slow burn. The opening, however, is brilliant.\n\n8. Boku dake ga Inai Machi\n\nRemember that movie Sliding Doors? It\u2019s basically the same thing except it\u2019s a dude and the scenes take place in a city. Anyway, it\u2019s very well executed and interesting. The show also throws in some time travel stuff for good measure, but not in a way that feels obnoxious or overused.\n\n7. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\n\nThe opening scene for this one is a conversation between two inmates at a prison in 1950s Japan. It\u2019s incredibly effective and the best part is that it\u2019s not even the focus of the episode. Instead, it\u2019s used as a way to introduce the main character, Yotarou. The rest of the episode is about his time in prison and how it affected him. It\u2019s a great story and leads perfectly into the rest of the show.\n\n6. Drifters\n\nThis is the perfect example of an anime with a good first episode. It doesn\u2019t waste your time with long-winded introductions, instead giving you just enough backstory to understand the series. Plus, it\u2019s just so stylish and well animated. I can\u2019t wait to see where this show goes from here.\n\n5. Re:Zero\n\nI think what I love about this episode is that it tells the audience that they can enjoy this series even if they don\u2019t remember the LN. It wastes no time in introducing the main character, Subaru, and his situation. He wakes up on the side of the road and gets involved in the first of many wacky shenanigans. It\u2019s not until the end of the episode that you realize he\u2019s somehow ended up in a video game world and that the story will likely go in a very different direction than you would have expected. The best thing about Re:Zero is that it takes the \u201csave the cat\u201d trope and turns it on its head, which is very refreshing.\n\n4. Bakuon!!\n\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly special about the opening episode, other than it does a good job of introducing the characters and their bikes. The real meat of the show is in the second episode, which involves the first real story arc. It\u2019s when the show really takes off and becomes funny and memorable.\n\n3. Orange\n\nWhat I love about this show is that it doesn\u2019t waste any time getting to the heart of the story. It begins with the main character, Naho, hearing a letter from herself ten years in the future. She relays the message to the people around her and as the story progresses, it becomes clear what the message means. It\u2019s also about her realizing that she has fallen in love with a boy and then learning to live with that. That is what the show is really about. It\u2019s sweet and perfect and it only takes one episode.\n\n2. Flying Witch\n\nThis is a simple show about a witch who moves in with her cousin and starts to live a normal life. The best part is that there\u2019s no drama involved, it\u2019s just about a girl learning how to be normal. I think that\u2019s why this series works. It\u2019s just a slice of life show about a girl, so there\u2019s no expectation that anything is going to happen. This is a show that you can watch while doing your homework or eating a bowl of ramen and that\u2019s why it\u2019s at number two on this list.\n\n1. Mayoiga\n\nWhat makes this the best first episode is that it absolutely destroyed my expectations. I was expecting a dull, low budget horror story and what I got was an incredible story with high stakes and brilliant cinematography. It also introduced a large number of characters, yet somehow made them all feel important and necessary. This is an amazing episode that set up a potentially great series and that\u2019s why it\u2019s the best of the season.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it for this list! What shows did I miss?

The pursuit of happiness is not found in fleeting pleasures. It is not found in materialism. It is not found in security. The pursuit of happiness is found in relationship.\n\nTo gain and to keep a foothold in happiness is to engage in the highest and most significant pursuits possible. It is to become the kind of person that no matter what comes, you are happy. It is to choose your pursuits wisely, and to change them as your heart dictates.\n\nLet me give you an example. Some of you know that I grew up in a faith-based Christian household. I am very grateful for my parents, but they did not have the happiest of marriages. My dad loved my mom, but he had a very hard time respecting her. He loved us children, but he had a hard time honoring us. As I grew up, it took me a long time to realize how much pain my parents\u2019 decisions caused each other and my brother and me. As I became an adult, I found that what I wanted most from a marriage was the ability to choose to pursue my wife\u2019s happiness. Not just by taking her out for fancy dinners and vacations, but by being intentional in my actions toward her, even on the days that are less exciting. To be intentional about spending time with her, even when my career was more important. To listen to her even when it is inconvenient or when it will hurt my feelings. To put her needs first, even when I disagree with her, and to encourage her and celebrate her for who she is.\n\nRelationship takes effort. Relationship takes intentionality. Relationship takes humility and grace. That is why I decided that it was more important to me than a successful career or any other accomplishment. That is why I want my marriage to be the highest pursuit of my life.\n\nIf you want to know the source of true happiness, then choose your pursuits wisely. You can be an excellent Christian, a great husband, a perfect parent, an excellent leader, a talented businessperson, or any of a number of pursuits that make the world better. But unless you are pursuing your wife, and maybe your kids, with all of your heart, then you are not going to find true happiness.\n\nToday is the first day of a new year. It is a day for new beginnings. What do you want to change in your life to make it more like the life of Christ?

The average age at which European lawyers leave the profession is 60. The problem of the age distribution of lawyers in Europe is particularly serious in Spain (only one out of five lawyers will reach retirement age), but is also a concern in France (35%), Germany (39%), Italy (42%) and the UK (45%). On the other hand, Belgium (59%), Austria (61%), Luxembourg (62%), the Netherlands (63%), Finland (64%) and Ireland (68%) are the countries where lawyers retire later.\n\nIn the past decade the situation in Europe has deteriorated as the number of lawyers over 50 has increased by more than two thirds. This situation has been described as a \u201ccliff edge\u201d, referring to the lack of trained successors.\n\nSome European jurisdictions are more flexible in allowing the retention of lawyers who reach retirement age. For instance, Ireland allows the practice of law even after 80 years of age. But these exceptions have not resolved the situation. On the contrary, as the number of lawyers in Europe decreases, their average age is also growing, leaving Europe with an even larger challenge in the future.\n\nAn ageing population is not the only problem that Europe\u2019s legal profession is facing. Younger lawyers who remain in the profession after completing their training, show a high rate of inactivity (one out of four young lawyers in Europe). One of the reasons for this is that in many countries there is a lack of opportunities to practise law.\n\nTherefore, the profession needs to address these problems by improving the work-life balance and offering better opportunities for young lawyers. Otherwise, the profession will continue to experience a demographic crisis.\n\nFor further information see: http://www.blr.europa.eu/blr-vlt/database-data/lawyer-age-average-retirement-europe-european-law-family/3_entry-page/6_entry-page-tab/88_entry-page-slider/]" time="0.292"><properties><property name="score" value="0.005407244" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00540724&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00540724

After all, there are far too many examples of police officers going over the line and injuring or even killing someone for a minor, or no, infraction.\n\nStill, there are good police officers, and there are police officers who are very supportive of black people, and the president of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers is the latter.\n\nDuring a panel discussion on police brutality, Terrence Cunningham, president of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, said it was a \u201cgreat policy\u201d to disarm a police officer if he or she acts violently towards a civilian.\n\nIn this case, Cunningham was talking about a police officer who assaulted a 15-year-old teenager. The officer slammed the teenager\u2019s head into a locker while searching him.\n\nBut Cunningham said something needs to be done.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about policy, it\u2019s really great to have a policy that requires a certain amount of force and then requires a certain amount of reporting,\u201d he said, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cBut I think we need to go beyond that. I think we need to say that if an officer uses a certain amount of force and it is unreasonable, then I think that\u2019s an offense that could lead to termination,\u201d Cunningham continued.\n\nHowever, he also said something has to be done on the part of the community as well.\n\n\u201cI think we need to address it from a policy perspective and also from a community perspective,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of kids in the community that don\u2019t trust law enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen they don\u2019t trust law enforcement, they\u2019re not going to report crime. When they don\u2019t report crime, they don\u2019t get reported. That\u2019s a problem. We\u2019ve got to work together to make people feel comfortable in reporting crime.\u201d\n\nTelling a police officer he or she should be fired if he or she is violent against a civilian is definitely a very good policy to have. Still, the issue of trust is just as big a problem.\n\nIf black people don\u2019t trust the police, and if police officers think they can treat anyone as they see fit because they\u2019re not afraid of being reported, then we have a real problem.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Constitution.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n]" time="0.294"><properties><property name="score" value="0.023746012" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.02374601&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.02374601

The new lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in California and claims that Wells Fargo violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against minorities in its mortgage lending division.\n\nThe lawsuit cited instances where loan officers were told to refer to African-American and Hispanic borrowers by code names, such as \u201cmud people\u201d and \u201cghetto customers,\u201d to indicate which customers were to receive inferior service.\n\nWells Fargo spokeswoman, Mary Eshet, denied the allegations, and called them \u201can attempt to extract money from the company.\u201d\n\n&quot;Wells Fargo disputes the claims and will contest this lawsuit vigorously,\u201d Eshet said in an email to the Times. \u201cThe allegations are an attempt to extract money from the company by litigious means.

The lawsuit, which was first filed in January in state court, was amended in March to include the allegations that employees discriminated against minorities.\n\nAt the center of the federal criminal investigation are Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of Wells Fargo's community banking division, and other high-ranking executives. Employees were forced to meet internal sales quotas or face firing. Many said they were ordered to \u201cpry into customers\u2019 lives,\u201d to boost sales.

In fact, the hype behind the TUF finale pales in comparison to that of the rematch between Jones and Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 165.\n\nAnd yet, what we saw at UFC 165 was not much of a fight. It was one of the most one-sided bouts we've seen in the UFC in quite some time. It was so one-sided that you may wonder how anyone in their right mind would even consider this a rematch.\n\nThe great thing about the sport of MMA is that there's always room for redemption. If you have a bad fight, you can always fight again. It's the fight game and you're going to get beat. The question is whether you come back stronger than before, or if you let your confidence be shaken and spiral down into the abyss.\n\nWith that said, here are the five things we've learned from the first fight between Jon Jones and Alexander Gustafsson.\n\n1. Jon Jones is the King of the Light Heavyweights\n\nIt was never really in doubt, but Jones' domination at UFC 165 reminded the MMA world that he is the number one light heavyweight in the world.\n\nGustafsson had Jones in trouble in the first round, but since then, the champ hasn't even broken a sweat. He did it with an efficient takedown game and a brutal top game.\n\nGustafsson is the one fighter that seems to be able to at least hang with Jones, but he didn't come anywhere close to taking the champ out. He couldn't take him down and he couldn't even score a takedown of his own.\n\nThe main question now is whether Jones can deal with Alexander Gustafsson's size. Gustafsson is the tallest fighter Jones has ever faced, and if he can handle that length and that reach, he could very well be unstoppable.\n\n2. Jones doesn't respect Gustafsson\n\nThe one thing you want to see from a champion is that he takes the guy he's fighting seriously. He has to, because the moment he takes his opponent for granted, the guy could end up shocking him.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn't the case at UFC 165. The entire fight, Jones fought as if he was just doing enough to win. He didn't even bother to engage in a little trash talk. And his disrespectful attitude afterward was more of the same.\n\nI get that he's the champ and he's not going to go overboard and lose his cool, but he should at least act like his opponent is dangerous and is not just a stepping stone for him.\n\nIf Gustafsson is ever going to get a rematch, he has to prove that he's the real deal. It will take a dominant win over the next opponent and a display of humility on his part, but a win over Glover Teixeira could be just what he needs.\n\n3. Size matters\n\nWhen it was announced that Jones and Gustafsson would have their rematch, most MMA fans were excited because we all knew it would be another great fight.\n\nWhat many of us did not expect, however, was how the fight would end up going. Most people expected a lot of striking between the two and to see who could best one another with the fewest amount of mistakes.\n\nThat is not what we got. Jones took Gustafsson down time and time again, and it was clear that the Swede was no match for the size of the champ.\n\nAlthough it's hard to say what would have happened if Gustafsson had been able to keep the fight standing, it's still not a very comforting thought to know that Gustafsson was outmatched by Jones in the grappling department.\n\n4. Jon Jones has some improvements to make\n\nThe first fight between Jones and Gustafsson was absolutely incredible and a lot of people would say that Jones was the clear-cut winner.\n\nI am not one of those people. Yes, Jones controlled the fight, but he wasn't as dominant as we all thought. Gustafsson had Jones in trouble in the first round and that is not something we see often with Jones.\n\nGustafsson has an incredible reach advantage, but that doesn't necessarily mean he will be able to hit Jones with his punches. After all, Gustafsson could not land a single significant punch and his best punch of the fight was a glancing blow.\n\nIf Gustafsson can hit Jones with his jab, he may have a chance, but he has to catch him first and that's a problem because Jones is incredibly fast. If he can put Jones on his back, however, he will most likely get the decision.\n\nIf there's one thing Jones has to work on, it's his takedown defense. It's not that he doesn't work on it because he does, but he needs to focus more on it.\n\n5. There are a lot of different ways to beat Jones\n\nI'm sure that most fans are excited for the possible rematch between Jones and Gustafsson, but even if Jones loses to Glover Teixeira, there are still a lot of options left for challengers.\n\nSome would say that Phil Davis could be a good opponent, but the reason that fight doesn't excite me is because Jones would simply take Davis down and it would be a one-sided beatdown.\n\nThen, there's Alexander Gustafsson, who I already mentioned and who has a good chance of beating Jones if he can figure out how to land his punches.\n\nAlthough that's a long shot, there are a few other fighters who could potentially beat Jones in the future. Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and Mauricio Rua are on the list as well as Glover Teixeira.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, it feels like the light heavyweight division has new life.\n\nThanks for reading, you can follow me on Twitter @RileyLittle.\n\nStay tuned right here at MMA Sucka for more live streams as well as videos highlighting the top fighters, commentators, coaches, promoters and other names in MMA and combat sports.

Chargers, it can be easy to forget about the rest of the AFC West. The division could be one of the most competitive in the NFL this season. The Chargers have been one of the more competitive teams for the past decade, the Chiefs and Raiders have shown that they have talent on their teams and the Broncos should still be one of the best teams in the league.\n\nBut with all that said, here are my predictions for the AFC West this season.\n\nDenver Broncos (11-5)\n\nThe Broncos are the defending Super Bowl Champions, so they have that going for them. They also return almost all of the players who made them a top offense and defense. Case Keenum is back and while he had a fantastic season last year, he is a streaky quarterback and can have some cold spells.\n\nThe Broncos have a tough schedule and some injuries can make this team vulnerable. But, it should be enough to get them to the playoffs and potentially another Super Bowl appearance.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (10-6)\n\nThe Chiefs are the team in the division with the most questions. After losing several defensive stars to free agency, the defense is going to have to improve. The offense is lead by an explosive group of skill position players, but the defense could still be a liability.\n\nThe Chiefs play a tough schedule this season, so the defense will have to show improvement. If the Chiefs have a down year, the Chargers will be there to take the division.\n\nOakland Raiders (9-7)\n\nThe Raiders had a huge turnaround last season after going from a team with little hope to a team with some momentum. They have an explosive offense and a good defense. However, they still have some of the same problems they\u2019ve had the past few years.\n\nThey still have issues protecting Derek Carr. Carr can make the big plays to score, but if the offensive line doesn\u2019t improve, the Raiders could see themselves under .500. The Raiders have the potential to be one of the best teams in the league, but I think they will have another so-so year.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (8-8)\n\nThe Chargers will be good this year. The problem is, it won\u2019t be enough. While the Chargers have an improved offense and a good defense, they have some tough losses in the division. The Chargers also play a tough schedule, which will lead to some tough games.\n\nThe Chargers have the potential to make some noise this year, but they will have to take a few wins from the Chiefs and Raiders.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\n]" time="0.365"><properties><property name="score" value="0.8655655" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Photo\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor is the country\u2019s leading source of independent, global news and insight. Its perceptive and experienced editors keep a sharp eye on world events and provide insightful analysis on issues of U.S. and international concern. In our Web Focus series, the Monitor\u2019s editors weigh in on timely topics with extended essays meant to take a broad look at the forces shaping our world.\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201ccyber-9/11\u201d? A cyberattack on a nuclear facility or a major dam that could release enough water to drown a major American city? A digital assault on the nation\u2019s banking system or a threat to the electrical grid that could plunge millions of Americans into darkness? The recent warnings from Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Agency director, Gen. Keith Alexander, suggest that such nightmare scenarios are indeed a possibility.\n\nBut if U.S. intelligence officials are to be believed, the greatest threat is an assault on the nation\u2019s financial institutions. After Dempsey warned Congress that the U.S. could \u201csee cyber incidents that have physical effects on our critical infrastructure,\u201d Alexander echoed his remarks by noting, \u201cA cyberattack that could have physical effects, that is the greatest fear.\u201d\n\nThe consensus is that a catastrophic cyberattack could wreak havoc on the U.S. economy. The reality, however, is far more complex and nuanced.\n\nDespite claims of major foreign-government backing for a digital assault on American banks, the truth is that such an operation is very unlikely. In recent years, foreign cyberintelligence agencies have tried to collect sensitive information about banks, including the names and Social Security numbers of their customers. A similar campaign targeting American credit-card companies in 2011 was likely perpetrated by the Syrian Electronic Army, a group of hackers supporting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This operation was relatively easy and inexpensive to conduct.\n\nThe reality is that America\u2019s banking system is highly resilient. Even after the catastrophic events of 2008, when hundreds of small and medium-sized banks failed, the country\u2019s largest institutions emerged from the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis in better shape than ever.\n\nThe system as a whole remains sound and is well capitalized. America\u2019s banks remain the best-run financial institutions in the world.\n\nAnother myth is that a digital assault on U.S. banks could cause financial panic. Such claims are hyperbolic. Bank customers in this country have ready access to digital accounts, and those who rely on more traditional methods, such as a teller, are quickly switching to digital channels as well.\n\nA cyberattack on America\u2019s banking system might undermine confidence in the safety of its networks, but there is little to indicate that customers would take their money out of banks in a large-scale panic. In 2011, when many U.S. banks suffered from a series of hacking attacks, there was no bank run. The attacks caused brief hiccups in the banking system but no lasting harm.\n\nThe threat that\u2019s garnering the most attention these days is an attack on the U.S. financial system from a foreign power. In 2010, the New York Times reported that China had hacked into the computers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the FBI arrested several suspects who were working at JPMorgan Chase and at least one other bank.\n\nIn response, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security launched an initiative to secure the American financial system from foreign-government attacks.\n\nThe odds of a major cyberattack from China or Russia are far less likely than most people believe. An American bank has little to gain from being penetrated by hackers. Both countries have thriving black markets in information that could be sold to interested parties, and the purchase price would be higher than the cost of a sophisticated cyberattack.\n\nThe most plausible threat is a \u201cdisruptive\u201d attack that, as Gen. Alexander put it, \u201cisn\u2019t to crash the system but to interrupt it in some way, to make people aware that the system isn\u2019t safe.\u201d Such an operation could easily come from a criminal hacker or foreign-government operatives.

He encourages them to continue in the service of the Lord despite the difficulties and dangers they face. These were the Israelites who left the safety and prosperity of Egypt for the uncertainties of Canaan. Their task was to displace the wicked Canaanites who occupied the land. This was no easy task, and many a valiant warrior fell in the struggle. Still the Lord promised to go before the Israelites and help them defeat the Canaanites and claim the land for their own.\n\nGod had promised to go before the Israelites. This is a familiar theme in the Old Testament. But it is also a familiar theme in the New Testament. Paul told the Hebrew believers in Rome, \u201cWherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:\u201d (Romans 5:12). In this statement Paul used two Old Testament examples to illustrate the extent of the power of sin to destroy life. First he noted that the life-giving properties of the soil were destroyed when Adam sinned. In the garden of Eden the ground had yielded to Adam and Eve fruits and nuts of every kind, but after the fall man was forced to work hard for his sustenance. Then Paul cited the most recent Old Testament example: \u201cFor when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves\u201d (Romans 2:14). The Lord had promised to go before the Israelites to help them drive out the Canaanites from the land of promise. After Adam\u2019s fall God said to the serpent, \u201cAnd I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel\u201d (Genesis 3:15). The serpent\u2019s head was bruised when Christ died for the sins of all men, but the serpent\u2019s head would ultimately be bruised by the Messiah\u2019s heel.\n\nAt the end of the Old Testament era God had to rescue His people Israel from a most perilous situation. The ten northern tribes had refused to obey God\u2019s commands and had rejected His prophets. Because of their sins God allowed Israel to be conquered by the Assyrian army and taken into exile. The Judahites and Benjaminites were spared destruction, but Judah was brought to the brink of extinction. God sent prophets to warn the Israelites of their imminent destruction, but they would not listen to the prophets. In spite of these disasters the Lord promised to go before His people to help them drive out the Canaanites from the land of promise.\n\nThe Israelites under Joshua drove out the Canaanites and occupied their land. But the Israelites were destined to live in a hostile world. The Canaanites had been their neighbors in Egypt. In the land of Canaan they were surrounded by nations hostile to the God of Israel.\n\nIn the life of the New Testament believer there are the same difficulties and dangers. It was never the purpose of God to give His children an easy life in this world. In fact, the Bible says, \u201cBlessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him\u201d (James 1:12). We must not be surprised by the temptations and trials that are part of the Christian life. \u201cFor whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth\u201d (Hebrews 12:6). The Lord\u2019s chastisements are part of His discipline, and His purpose in chastening us is not to destroy us but to bring us to maturity.\n\nHow do we endure these trials and temptations? We endure by remembering that we are engaged in the battle of the Lord. It is not our strength that carries us through, but the Lord Himself. \u201cFor the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee\u201d (Deuteronomy 31:6).\n\nIs it easy to trust the Lord with all my cares and burdens? No, it is not easy to trust the Lord with the details of my life, but it is necessary. If we do not trust Him to be our guide, our protector, our helper, our comforter, we cannot live a godly life. We have to trust Him, but we have to do more than that. We have to walk by faith, not by sight. This is not easy to do. There are times when it is very difficult to trust the Lord in the midst of great troubles. We have to take a stand of faith and put our trust in the Lord in the midst of overwhelming trials and temptations. This is the only way to have victory over our enemies and the enemies of the Lord. \u201cBe strong, and of good courage; fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee\u201d (Deuteronomy 31:6).\n\nGod\u2019s promise to go before the Israelites was a promise of victory over the enemies of Israel, and the same promise is made to every believer. God wants His people to know that He will help them overcome every obstacle in the Christian life. The greatest promise that God makes to His people is that He will not forsake them. This promise applies not only to our trials and temptations, but also to our sins and the temptations of Satan. \u201cFor God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (I Thessalonians 5:9). The word \u201cappoint\u201d means to arrange beforehand. It is in the Lord\u2019s providential plan that we are to obtain salvation, and He will arrange for us to have that salvation. The word \u201cwrath\u201d means a dreadful passion. The Lord has not planned for us to experience His dreadful anger. He has planned that we should live in the love and grace of His own presence. The Holy Spirit comes to live in our hearts and abide with us forever. In His own time He will gather us to be with Him forever in heaven. But until that time comes He will abide with us and go before us to help us overcome the enemies of our souls. He will not forsake us.]" time="0.623"><properties><property name="score" value="0.386918514" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.38691851&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.38691851

This is of course great news, but is it enough to attract investors and businesses to this new project?\n\nHere are five things you need to know about EOS.\n\n1. The EOS is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap\n\nRight now, EOS is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world with a total market cap of over 14 billion dollars. You will also find out that this is way behind of the biggest one \u2013 bitcoin, with almost $250 billion total market cap.\n\n2. EOS is a platform, not a token\n\nAs mentioned above, EOS is not a token \u2013 it is a platform that allows developers to create apps on the EOS blockchain. While this may sound strange to some people, you can easily see the reasoning behind this.\n\nWith EOS, all dApps on the platform will work with each other in order to create a better end-user experience. EOS is also designed to provide the possibility for the new developers to launch their applications in a few minutes, without having to write any code.\n\nEOS has a great potential because its founders are already the creators of one of the most popular crypto platforms \u2013 Block.one, which also made a lot of money from its $4 billion token sale last year.\n\n3. EOS wants to become a better Ethereum\n\nMany people claim that EOS wants to become a better version of Ethereum. They are also looking to become the most powerful infrastructure for dApp developers, and they are also targeting some of the biggest industries like social media, finance, supply chain, healthcare, and others.\n\n4. EOS launched its first dApp called \u2018Plebs\u2019\n\nOne of the first dApps that will launch on the EOS platform is called \u201cPlebs\u201d. This is a social network for blockchain enthusiasts and cryptocurrency traders. The first thing that you will notice when you log in is the \u201ccryptocurrency wallet\u201d button that will allow users to trade all sorts of tokens on the platform.\n\n5. EOS\u2019 token distribution was one of the biggest in history\n\nEOS managed to raise almost $4 billion from its token distribution event back in 2017. For comparison, the second biggest crowd sale was for Ethereum, which managed to raise $18 million in the same year.\n\nWhile EOS has an interesting approach and has a good team, the launch of EOS MainNet will determine whether this project will succeed or not. The first version of EOS MainNet is expected to go live on June 1st, 2018.\n\nWe will be updating our subscribers as soon as we know more.

That's when they decided to rework it into a movie, which will have its own narrative, but will also be tied to the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loeb and Feige stressed that the show is a completely different property from the movies, but that they do want to see it connect.\n\nAs a result of this change, the pilot of the show, which was already shot, will not be used.

It will run for eight episodes, which will then air in a two-hour TV event. The eight-episode run will be followed by the first two episodes of The Inhumans television show, which will then air weekly on ABC. It's unclear if the subsequent six episodes will debut exclusively on the TV show, or in theaters before TV.\n\nAll eight episodes will be made available on the same day for viewers who want to watch on TV. The show will debut on Imax for two weeks.\n\nSo what does this mean for the characters who are set to appear on the show? Black Bolt and Medusa will definitely appear, but they won't be played by Anson Mount and Serinda Swan. Marvel did not announce who will take over the roles of the two leaders of the Inhuman Royal Family.\n\nOn the other hand, Maximus the Mad will be portrayed by Iwan Rheon (Game of Thrones), who's replacing Ken Leung. He was shown on the big screen at the panel.\n\nShowrunner Scott Buck, who's also worked on Iron Fist, is sticking around for the reworked version of the show.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nThe panel also announced several new cast members for the Inhumans movie, including:\n\nEllen Woglom will play an unidentified character.\n\nwill play an unidentified character.

Too big, some might say. One of the nice things about this small, tightly-controlled island is that the government keeps the population contained in small, well-defined areas, or \u201cestates\u201d. And if you know anything about me, you know I love it when things are tightly controlled. But the trouble is that most of the estates are quite old and, therefore, cramped. So Singapore is often ranked near the top in the dubious \u201cquality of living\u201d lists. But it\u2019s a small price to pay for the island\u2019s many other virtues. And like I said, Singaporeans know what they are doing.\n\nOne thing that they have done is devise the wonderfully named \u201cqueue jump lanes\u201d for the MRT (subway). And the way that it works is simple: instead of everyone using a bunch of doors to get on and off the train, the doors are grouped by destination and one door in each group is for the \u201cqueue jump\u201d lane. The \u201cjumpers\u201d simply get in line to board the train at a set of doors that they are waiting at and if enough people are waiting behind them (they have to be at least three or four), then the train doors open for them and they can board the train.\n\nBut what makes this so great is that the MRT station doesn\u2019t really have any huge lines. Everyone is in the same line to board the train and it works very efficiently. And because the commuters are all in the same line, the stations don\u2019t get too crowded and everyone gets on and off the train quickly. And it\u2019s such a simple, elegant solution to the age-old problem of waiting in line to board a train. But it has to be done in a very organized manner or it will not work. And Singaporeans are good at organizing things. And they are good at following instructions. So it works.\n\nThis is why Singaporean officials now have big plans to clean up the Internet in their island state. They are just following orders. You see, Singapore is a clean and neat place, like an apartment or a house. And it\u2019s a small island with lots of people. And if you have people living together and living closely together, you will have problems with things like personal space, personal hygiene and cleanliness. And Singapore has rules for these things, just like any other well-ordered and tidy city. And because of these rules, it is a good place to live. And the Internet is a wild and wooly place that needs to be tamed.\n\nThe government has already started to act against sites with porn and gambling. But the new, bold and determined, Internet-cleanup effort has begun. The effort will tackle sites that \u201cadvocate homosexuality, obscenity, violence, terrorism or any other illicit activities.\u201d And with those loose guidelines, I\u2019m sure the government will be able to take down all sorts of sites. But Singapore is a good place to live and it should be a good place to surf.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last few years cleaning up the sites I have on the Internet, as well as cleaning up myself. I\u2019ve stopped going to a therapist because I feel good. I\u2019ve stopped going to AA meetings because I\u2019m no longer an alcoholic. And I\u2019ve stopped going to NA meetings because I\u2019m no longer a drug addict. And now I\u2019m sure that I will never be at a gambling site again because I\u2019m no longer a gambler. And I\u2019m sure that I will never see any sites with porn, but that\u2019s just because I\u2019m too lazy to look for it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not advocating that people with any of those problems should try to change. Those things are just the bad in my life. But I know that I am on the right track and I am making progress. And I have not been to a therapist in two months and I have not been to an AA meeting in over three months. And I have not been to a NA meeting in more than a year.

They claim that they are a political party, they are running for parliament. But in reality, they are a political gang.\n\nWhat is a political party? A political party is a group of people that thinks about political ideas, and formulates these into political goals. This group tries to get a certain number of people elected to the parliament. They may also want to participate in elections for other types of political bodies. For example, the &quot;Alternative f\xfcr Deutschland&quot; is also running for the European Parliament.\n\nWhat is a political gang? A political gang is a group of people that thinks about political ideas, but only to a certain degree. The group isn't actually trying to get people elected, but tries to create political pressure in other ways. They may also try to influence public opinion, as far as that is possible for a political gang.\n\nBoth political parties and political gangs are a waste of time. Both types of group are only interested in the power to influence. If one looks at the political agenda of the AfD, it can be seen that it is only interested in getting into the parliament. They don't care about any political ideas. They don't have any. They only want to get their political friends into the parliament.\n\nSome AfD members might think that they are doing their country a service. But in reality, they are helping to lower the political quality of Germany. They are helping to lower the German nation's intellectual level. They are doing this by political gang behavior. By not acting as a political party, they are deliberately working against democracy, and undermining the nation's sovereignty.\n\nIf the AfD members want to get into the parliament, they should at least act like a political party. They should actually talk about ideas. The AfD should have a political program. This political program should deal with Germany's immigration and emigration problems, as well as with other political issues. This program should be something that all members of the party agree upon. This program should then be explained to the public in a reasonable manner. The program should be accessible to everyone.\n\nThe AfD should make their political program available to the public in book form. This book should be made available for a minimal fee, and it should be available online, too. This book should be available in the &quot;Kaufhof&quot; chain of bookstores, as well as on Amazon.com and other online bookstores. It should also be available in the electronic version of the book on the AfD website.\n\nThe AfD could use the money received from selling the political program to cover their political expenses. This would also help to explain the political program to the public. It could even result in the members of the AfD getting a new impression of what a political party should be.\n\nA political gang should not run for parliament. They should not call themselves a political party. A political gang is not a substitute for a political party.

Let\u2019s unpack that a little.\n\nFirst, Bernie\u2019s supporters aren\u2019t saying they want their candidate to win the nomination just to vote for Clinton. They want him to win. They want to see the revolution he\u2019s been talking about since he started running for president.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering how he\u2019s going to get to the White House without the millions of dollars in negative ads that are part of the \u201cswamp\u201d Clinton herself says she\u2019s going to drain, the answer is by actually inspiring people to vote for him because of his ideas. He\u2019s not taking money from big corporations and wealthy people. He\u2019s getting it from individual donors, just like Bernie Sanders.\n\nSecond, if Sanders supporters are supposed to be naive to think they can get a revolution by electing a candidate who will help to bring one about, then Hillary Clinton supporters are just plain delusional.

I'm a senior in college, so it's nice to have something that makes me look professional in the summer time, without having to worry about how long it takes to style it each morning.\n\nSo she started cutting it and it looked good. It was only $11, which is a good price for a haircut. I waited there for about 15 minutes before the girl finished cutting it and called me over to the dryers. I sat down and she blow dried my hair with a round brush, which I don't normally do, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference. As she started to dry it, I started to notice how choppy it looked. She said &quot;it looks really good. I'm glad I cut it so short, I was thinking about cutting it longer, but I think you look good like this&quot;. I was disappointed because my hair looked terrible, but at least it was only $11, and I was able to get it cut before I had to go back to class.\n\nWhen I went to class, I went up to my professor to show her how awful the haircut looked.

I said that I didn't think it was worth the money to have them fix it, so I asked how I could get my money back. They said I could go to another location and get another haircut to use the coupon that was still on it.\n\nThe next morning, I went to Great Clips on South Highway 25. I got there and was greeted by a very nice girl. I explained to her the situation, and she said that she would be happy to fix it. She washed it out and put a trim on it.

Some of these undead are highly intelligent, acting as soldiers in armies or guardians of tombs. More powerful undead have been known to roam the world under their own volition, seeking to kill the living for revenge or to fuel their undeath.\n\nBeing intelligent creatures, undead can be found in many different social standings. In the cities of civilized races, the dead are commonly entombed and given proper funerals, while necromancers sometimes command vast armies of the undead to do their bidding.\n\nAnimate Dead [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user is able to make the corpse of a creature move and attack.\n\nThe undead created will depend on the level of the magic-user:\n\nIf the magic-user is 1st level, then the undead can be a corpse of a man-sized animal such as a wolf, bear, or lion. The corpse may be &quot;animated&quot; with the appropriate skills such as: Climb, Hide, or Move Silently. The DM will determine what skills the corpse has.\n\nIf the magic-user is 2nd level, then the undead can be a man-sized corpse with two or more of the above skills. For every level beyond 2nd level, the corpse may gain another skill.\n\nAnimated dead may be commanded by the controlling magic-user as a free action, or they may be allowed to wander without purpose as mindless automatons. The undead may also be set to attack one target only or be left free to attack any target within range. The undead may be controlled in such a way as to be under the command of any creature holding the control device, as a charge-based device or wand, as a magical amulet, or by any other means.\n\nIf the magic-user is killed, then the control device is automatically destroyed. If the magic-user is unwilling to control the undead, or if he wishes to relinquish control, then the undead must make a Will save against the magic-user's level +2 or become uncontrolled.\n\nThe animate dead spell cannot create any undead creature with a 4+1 or better on the Hit Dice. If the corpse is missing a limb or appendage, the corpse may not use that particular appendage. The missing limb may be reattached by a cleric with 8+ experience level. The reattachment requires 1 minute of chanting, a flask of holy water, a light fire, and two torches.\n\n\n\nExample: Thaeron, a 1st level magic-user, animates a dead wolf with the skill climb, but the wolf has no skill of hide. This wolf can move, but is not able to hide from the sight of the living.\n\n\n\nExample: Kairon, a 3rd level magic-user, animates a wolf, giving it the skills of climb, hide, and move silently. Kairon now has a very stealthy animal to use for reconnaissance.\n\n\n\nExample: Emric, a 5th level magic-user, animates a dead lion. Emric now has a formidable beast to add to his retinue.\n\nCAUTION: Undead created through this spell may not be raised or resurrected. Only the spell life can restore the dead to life.\n\nAstral Prison [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user causes a single creature to be imprisoned within its own body. This spell cannot be dispelled, but may be ended by a successful Dispel Magic spell cast upon the victim.\n\nThe victim of the Astral Prison spell will not be able to take any actions, but will be able to communicate normally with any creature within the same square as the victim.

This article is written to enlighten you with facts that may not be known to you about bees.\n\n#1: Male Bees are All Slackers\n\nIt has been a common fact that male bees are the slackers in the bee world. Male bees don't help much in the nest building or care of the young ones, but they enjoy mating and honey. As the female bees usually do all the work, some of them live alone.\n\n#2: They Don't See Red\n\nBees see in colors, but don't have the ability to see the color red. They don't have the ability to see this color because their eyes don't have red light receptors.\n\n#3: Do You Know What Bees Eat?\n\nWe all know that bees feed on nectar, but it is not their only source of food. Bees also feed on pollen, and other sweets.\n\n#4: Honey Bees Are Not Biting\n\nHoney bees have two tiny, barbed stingers and they sting only when they feel threatened or they are protecting their hives or their young ones. Honey bees don't go about biting people and this is the reason why they are so loved.\n\n#5: How Much Honey Do Bees Produce?\n\nBees use honey to survive the winter season. Bees produce honey by sucking out the nectar from flowers. Honey is a bee's primary food and it makes up 80% of its diet. The amount of honey produced by bees is variable and depends on the flowering of plants and the weather.\n\n#6: The Queen Has Only One Boyfriend\n\nA queen bee mates only once in her life. After this mating, she will live for about five years and during this time, she will lay more than 1500 eggs per day.\n\n#7: Only Worker Bees Produce Honey\n\nIn the beehive, only worker bees produce honey. The queen bee has no role to play in honey production. It is the workers who collect the nectar and turn it into honey. The queen just lays eggs.\n\n#8: Life Cycle of a Honey Bee\n\nA honey bee goes through three stages of development, which are: egg, larva and adult. It takes about 21 days for a honey bee to complete its life cycle.\n\n#9: The Nest of a Bee is Always Busy\n\nIf you think the nest of a bee is quiet and empty, you are mistaken. The nest of a bee is always busy and buzzing with activity. The queen bee lays around 1,500 eggs every day.\n\n#10: Did You Know That Bees Sting?\n\nWe have heard this fact many times, but we don't think that we will ever come across bees in our gardens. But bees can sting and they do sting if they feel threatened or disturbed.\n\n#11: Honey Bees Can Live Only in America\n\nThere are about 4,000 species of honey bees all over the world and only one species can be found in America. It is the European honey bee. This species of honey bee is found in South and Central America, North America and some parts of Asia and Australia.\n\n#12: A Bee Makes Six Flights Every Day\n\nEach bee has to make six flights every day for the development of the honey comb. Bees make their honeycombs in a hexagonal shape.\n\n#13: There Are Female Only and Male Only Bees\n\nBees are either female or male.

The event will be broadcast live in English, Spanish and Portuguese to millions of viewers around the world.\n\nDownloadable HD video for journalists\n\nDownloadable HD video for journalists\n\nDownloadable HD video for journalists\n\nThe October general conference sessions are always held in the Conference Center on Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Conference Center was completed in 2000 and has been the location for the LDS Church's general conference sessions since that time.\n\nThe Conference Center seats 21,000 people, more than the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Although the Tabernacle was designed to seat more than 10,000 people, it has not been used for general conference in many years.\n\nThe Tabernacle, constructed in 1867, is the second oldest religious building in Utah and the oldest on Temple Square. The building has had many names and occupants, and it was damaged by fire several times.\n\nThe Tabernacle was the first home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and was used by the choir and others as a temporary home until the Assembly Hall was completed in 1877. The Tabernacle then became the home of the world-renowned choir for the next 62 years.\n\nThe Tabernacle was gutted by fire in 1867, 1873 and 1882. The fire in 1867 destroyed the roof, and the Tabernacle was closed for a year. Reconstruction and repairs were made quickly, and the Tabernacle reopened on July 4, 1868.\n\nThe Tabernacle, built of rock, mortar and local timber, was the only building on Temple Square for 30 years. In 1888, the Assembly Hall, built of wood, was added.\n\nThe Manti Temple, constructed in 1888, was the first building on Temple Square to be constructed of stone. The Utah State Capitol was completed in 1896, and the Temple block in Salt Lake City was becoming an architectural showcase.\n\nIn 1893, the Salt Lake Temple, constructed of granite and marble, was completed. The Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle were designed by church architect Truman O. Angell. In addition to his work for the church, he designed the Cathedral of the Madeleine and the Ogden Tabernacle.\n\nDuring construction of the Temple and Tabernacle, Angell took measurements and photographs of the original Nauvoo Temple. Those measurements and photos provided the basis for construction of the Nauvoo Temple, which was completed in 2002.\n\nAfter the completion of the Salt Lake Temple, many of the early leaders of the LDS Church felt the need to have another temple built in Salt Lake City to accommodate the thousands of faithful members who could not live in the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nWork on the Endowment House, the temple precursor, began in 1855. However, construction was delayed because of a financial depression. The LDS Church decided to cease construction of the Endowment House in 1856 and to use the structure as a school for Indian children.\n\nIn 1869, construction of the Endowment House resumed. The original plan called for an expanded facility, but the leaders of the LDS Church decided to keep the building small, and the temple ordinances were performed in the Endowment House for the next 62 years.\n\nThe Endowment House was destroyed by fire on the morning of Dec. 17, 1892. The decision to build a new temple was made immediately, and the location of the new temple was decided in the afternoon.\n\nThe decision to build a new temple came from the experiences of church president Wilford Woodruff in the St. George Temple. Woodruff often stayed in the St. George Temple during visits to southern Utah. During one of those visits, he had a dream in which he saw an angel. The angel instructed him to return to the St. George Temple and perform the sacred endowments.\n\nUpon his return, Woodruff was unable to locate the temple and was disappointed. However, as he was returning to his hotel, he had a second dream in which he again saw the angel. The angel instructed Woodruff to perform the sacred endowments in the St. George Temple as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition, the LDS Church presidency was in dire need of a new temple. The Endowment House was becoming crowded and was not large enough for the members.\n\nAfter his experiences in St. George, Woodruff was directed by an angel to build a new temple. The building committee selected the site in 1892 and selected the current location for the temple in 1894.\n\nThe LDS Church has been in continuous construction of temples since 1833, when the Kirtland Temple was completed. The first temple was destroyed in a fire in 1838.\n\nAs of the beginning of the semiannual general conference on Oct. 3, 2016, there were 137 temples in operation around the world and a total of 148 in various stages of construction. The first LDS temple outside of the United States was built in Bern, Switzerland, and dedicated in 1955.\n\nThe Salt Lake Temple, the oldest LDS temple still in operation, is in the final stages of a two-year renovation.\n\nThe conference sessions will begin with a meeting of general conference leadership, including the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, at 6:30 p.m. MST on Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, the session will begin at 9 a.m. and be broadcast live on the LDS Church satellite system and on Mormon Channel, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nThe priesthood and Sunday sessions will be held at 10 a.m. The general priesthood meeting will be broadcast live on Mormon Channel and on the LDS Church satellite system, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nThe general women's meeting will be held at 5 p.m. The meeting will be broadcast live on Mormon Channel and on the LDS Church satellite system, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nThe general sessions on Saturday will begin at 10 a.m. The priesthood and Sunday sessions will be held at 1 p.m. Both of the Saturday sessions will be broadcast live on Mormon Channel and on the LDS Church satellite system, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nFollowing the conference sessions, the Tabernacle Choir will present a concert in the Conference Center at 8 p.m. on Saturday, which will be broadcast live on the LDS Church satellite system and on Mormon Channel.\n\n[email protected]]" time="0.605"><properties><property name="score" value="0.019818002" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[The 9/11 suspects and the FBI's elite\n\nThere's a new development in the endless story of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the killing of Osama bin Laden: Allegations that FBI agents on an elite unit violated rules by exceeding their surveillance authority.\n\nIn the latest investigative account, the Associated Press reports that these agents also spent as many as 15,000 hours each \u2014 that's five full-time work years \u2014 monitoring as many as 5,000 Americans. The AP claims this happened from 2002 to 2008.\n\nThe allegations are already roiling Capitol Hill, and the case could become a major embarrassment for the FBI. Lawmakers are raising questions about why they weren't told sooner, and what kind of surveillance was involved.\n\nThis development has some historical echoes for me.

And I reported that one al-Qaeda plotter who slipped through the FBI's fingers was involved in a New Jersey case that also raised privacy concerns.\n\nThe FBI's new problems stem from an agent on the bureau's &quot;transnational&quot; squad. That team was established in 2000 to collect intelligence on threats from groups or individuals abroad, then translate and analyze it for use by FBI agents on domestic crimes.\n\nThe PENTTBOMB squad had been formed after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which was committed by an American who used fertilizer and fuel oil to kill 168 people. Among the dead were 19 children, and the blast devastated a federal office building.\n\nAn FBI supervisor suspected an Islamic extremist link, so PENTTBOMB agents were put on the case. The name is a truncation of &quot;pentagon&quot; and &quot;Tower,&quot; a reference to the location of the attack.\n\nThe team went on to investigate two other attacks with similar ties: the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200 people and injured 5,000 more, and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole off Yemen, which killed 17 American sailors.\n\nThe PENTTBOMB team eventually went on to a separate mission: tracking Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks.\n\n(For a while, the FBI's most prominent post-9/11 agent was John O'Neill, who died in the World Trade Center attacks. O'Neill was on the PENTTBOMB squad and had been the chief of counterterrorism at the FBI's New York office. I spoke with him a number of times in 1998 and 1999.

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn American society, the most important basis for a successful marriage is to be found in the universal and unchanging relationship of male and female. The male as head of the family has an intrinsic responsibility for the wellbeing and well-being of his wife and children. For a man, failure to fulfill that responsibility constitutes not only a sin against God but also a sin against society. The reason for this is that men are obliged to marry to propagate the race. Since the greater portion of the burden for this is placed upon men, they must realize their responsibility for providing a home. The institution of marriage, then, is a social and economic institution. Without it, society would not survive.\n\nThe idea of male headship is also founded on the fact that men and women are intrinsically different, as the Creator has made them. From the beginning of Creation, God has given men the leadership role, which was expressed in the headship of Adam over Eve. Even in the animal world, males take the leadership role over females. This idea of male headship continues through the history of Israel as the Lord selected men for leadership roles: Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, for example. Even after the sin in the Garden of Eden, God instructed Adam that it was necessary for him to provide for his wife and children.\n\nThe male and female are fundamentally different in some significant ways. Males have always been given greater physical strength. Moreover, women, as a whole, are physically weaker. They are also emotionally more sensitive than men and, therefore, have the responsibility for bearing and raising children. The male is, however, called upon to be the provider for the family. The man is, therefore, also obligated to work hard to provide for his wife and children, as a way of showing his love for his family. Men are to do this while their wives are bearing and raising children, so that they may also participate in these responsibilities to the fullest extent possible.\n\nTo further clarify the distinction between male and female, we have to consider the differences between a man and a woman's sexuality. God created women and men with different sexual natures, which include both a complementary function and a distinctive one. The function is complementary in the sense that a man and woman can only have sexual union with one another. Thus, their bodies are in harmony. However, the distinctive nature of men and women is that men can perform the sexual act without giving birth to children. The woman, however, cannot perform the sexual act without giving birth to children.\n\nMarriage is intended to be a total commitment between a man and woman. As such, it is a lifetime commitment, made by two people who give themselves to each other and to God. The importance of marriage to God is shown in the fact that He has designed it to be a lifelong relationship. Moreover, when man rejects the ideal of marriage that God has established for society, the relationship becomes a base matter of selfishness and self-gratification. Such a relationship is, at best, a poor substitute for the God-ordained institution. However, as in all sin, it is not the same as the ideal. Sin always has a negative effect on society. It is for this reason that God calls on mankind to obey Him. It is also why the Scriptures say that God hates divorce.\n\nII. WHY DIVORCE IS HATED BY GOD\n\nThe Scriptures show that divorce is a sin that God hates. He is displeased with it because it brings the curse of God on a society. The Scriptures condemn it in the strongest possible language and hold the man who has divorced his wife as being worse than the man who has never married at all.\n\nThe Mosaic Law expressly forbid divorce. This is not to be understood in a legal sense, since the Jews could divorce their wives by reason of her adultery (Deut. 22:21). Moreover, the Jews could divorce a non-Jewish wife by reason of her apostasy (Deut. 24:1-4). In both of these cases, the idea of divorce is understood in a religious context and is not limited to a legal system. This is true of other cases of divorce in the Old Testament as well. The husband can also divorce his wife for the more general reasons of neglect and cruelty (Deut. 22:19-21). In these cases, the idea of divorce is in a more general sense and not limited to a legal system.\n\nAt the beginning of the Christian Era, the Christian Church began to understand that marriage was intended to be a total commitment between two people, who had made a vow before God. Such a vow is understood to be a promise of lifelong commitment to each other and to God. As such, it was understood that such a vow could not be broken. In the fourth century, the Roman Church, under the leadership of Constantine, recognized this by excluding divorce from the authority of the Church. This is one of the reasons that marriage is seen as a sacrament in the Roman Church. It is also why the Church has, since that time, refused to grant a decree of divorce, even for adultery.\n\nThe idea of a lifetime commitment between a man and woman is also evident in the case of Paul and his wife, who are said to be &quot;one flesh.&quot; Thus, Paul is exhorting believers to live in such a way that they do not bring disgrace upon their &quot;brother.&quot; Moreover, Paul recognizes that this marriage between himself and his wife is the basis for all marriage. Therefore, if a believer is to live with his wife as if she were his sister, this would also require that he do the same to all the brothers and sisters of the Church.\n\nThe Apostle Peter speaks of divorce in his first letter in language similar to Paul's. This was also the view of the Early Church, both Catholic and Protestant. It is also the view of the Orthodox Churches, who do not permit divorce.\n\nIII. CHURCH TEACHINGS ON DIVORCE\n\nThe Church Fathers, such as Origen, did not believe that there could be a legal dissolution of marriage. According to Origen, &quot;Christ was not to dissolve those marriages that are joined together by the solemn authority of the state, nor was He to abolish these rules which man in his law has established for the purpose of the procreation and the education of children, but He was to strengthen them.&quot; The Church Fathers believed that divorce was wrong because it separated man and wife. Marriage was a sacred union, which was made by God and was not subject to man's laws. However, this was not to be understood in a legal sense. It was wrong to divorce one's wife even though the laws of a nation permitted it. Moreover, this was to be the case even if the woman had committed adultery. Divorce was still wrong.\n\nThe Church Fathers viewed marriage as a sacrament. The idea that marriage was a sacrament is present in the early Church, even though it was not a formal decree of the Church until the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. Marriage is recognized as a sacrament because it represents the love between Christ and His Church. Marriage is thus a sign of the covenant between Christ and His Church. Marriage is not only a sign of this covenant but also a means by which this covenant is expressed. Therefore, marriage is an important sacrament of the Christian Church.\n\nIn his Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, St. Augustine makes it clear that the idea of a &quot;sacrament&quot; does not mean that marriage is a sign of the love between Christ and His Church. Marriage is a sacrament in the sense that it is a sacred reality, which is the sign of something else. It is the sacred reality, the divine idea that is the true sign of marriage. This is true of all the sacraments, in which the sign is a reality that is above the natural order. Therefore, the sacramental sign is but a small part of the reality to which it points. It is for this reason that the Church has forbidden remarriage after divorce. It is not because the Church has an opinion of divorce. The Church has always had an opinion of divorce. In the Early Church, however, remarriage after divorce was considered a sin. This is true even in cases where the woman had committed adultery.\n\nThe Orthodox Churches and the Roman Catholic Church have the same view on this matter. The Orthodox Church is opposed to divorce because it violates the principle of unity between Christ and His Church. They also understand the doctrine of marriage as an indissoluble union. It is this idea of marriage that is seen as the basis of the Orthodox teaching. The Roman Catholic Church also has the same view as the Orthodox Churches. The difference between the two churches is that the Roman Church has understood this to be a teaching that is rooted in Divine Revelation, whereas the Orthodox Churches have taken this to be the position of the Early Church.\n\nHowever, both the Roman Church and the Orthodox Churches have also taken this to be the teaching of the Early Church. In his Homilies on the Epistles of Paul to the Corinthians, Origen declares that marriage is a symbol of the union between Christ and His Church. This is the same teaching that is found in the Roman Church. Origen also takes this to be the teaching of the Early Church.\n\nIn his Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Augustine takes the same position. He sees marriage as a sacrament, in the sense that it represents the union between Christ and His Church.

It can be thought of as a huge hashmap, with the ability to do a variety of different operations in an atomic fashion. One of the most common use cases for Redis is a LRU cache. In this post I'll describe the inner workings of the LRU algorithm in Redis, and how to use it effectively to speed up your applications.\n\nRedis and LRU\n\nRedis has a variety of different datatypes that you can store in a key. You can store a string, a list, a hash, a set, and even more exotic types like geospatial indexes and pub/sub channels.\n\nThe most common datatype you'll use in Redis is the hash, which is just a set of strings, stored under a single key. You'll also use the string type to store a variety of things, including session ids, and passwords.\n\nOne thing that you can do with a hash in Redis is use it as a cache. If you want to store a large dataset in memory, but want to do it with a very small footprint, you can use Redis as a hash-based cache.\n\nThe implementation of the LRU algorithm in Redis is more than just a simple feature, it is also the method that allows Redis to work as a cache. The LRU algorithm allows Redis to store your data in a very compact way, while also keeping it easily accessible.\n\nA Simple Example\n\nSuppose you have an application that stores a hash map of users, and each user has a name and a list of sessions. A session is just a string that represents an entry in the cache.\n\nIf we want to write the number of users in a session to the console, we can do something like this:\n\nIn redis-cli , type smembers *:user_name* , where user_name is the name of the user in the hash. This will return a list of sessions in this user's hash. Type smembers *:sessions* , where sessions is the key we used to store the sessions. This will return the number of sessions that we had in step 2.\n\nAs a quick note, in this example I am using &quot;*&quot; as a wildcard, this is done because I am not guaranteed that my keys have any characters after the colon.\n\nThis is the simplest example, but it works well to show how to use the Redis LRU algorithm to your advantage.\n\nIf you have a hash where each element represents a cached entry, your application is running well if each time you query the hash, the number of elements that you get is exactly the number of times you are using the hash in your application.\n\nTo explain why this is, let's do a simple analysis of a few different cases.\n\nImagine that the user &quot;John Smith&quot; has a hash, where each key is a session, and each value is a timestamp.\n\nIf we have 50 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return the same number of elements every time.\n\nIf we have 50 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return the same number of elements every time. If we have 10 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return exactly 10 elements every time.\n\nIf we have 10 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return exactly 10 elements every time. If we have 5 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return either 5 or 6 elements every time, depending on whether the hash was queried during the first or second query.\n\nThis simple example is sufficient to show that the number of queries that are made to the cache are more important than the average number of items returned.\n\nThe number of times you query your cache is directly related to the amount of work your application is doing. If you have a lot of work to do, your application will make more queries to your cache. The way we can use this is by tuning the value of our cache to be more or less aggressive.\n\nThere are a few things that you can change to influence the aggressiveness of your cache.

To start, it's the latest blow to the administration's credibility after a litany of controversies, including reports that Trump's campaign aides were in constant communication with Russian intelligence officials during the election.\n\nBut it also illustrates the confusion and infighting that has defined the Trump White House.\n\n&quot;The problem is that, given all the chaos and competing power centers in the White House, it's not clear who is really running the show at any given time,&quot; said Ben Rhodes, a former senior foreign policy official under President Barack Obama. &quot;That makes it hard for the administration to have the kind of coherence it needs to conduct a well-organized foreign policy.&quot;\n\nFlynn's resignation followed a series of damaging leaks about the president's senior staff and other high-ranking administration officials.\n\nNational security adviser Flynn denied discussing sanctions with Russian envoy\n\nA report published Monday night said top Trump aides, including chief of staff Reince Priebus, White House counsel Don McGahn and press secretary Sean Spicer, kept Trump in the dark about Flynn's conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in order to &quot;protect the president from himself.&quot;\n\nIn mid-January, the administration told the Washington Post that Flynn did not discuss the sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia for meddling in the US election. Those sanctions were expected to be a topic of conversation between Flynn and Kislyak, but Pence and other senior officials, including McGahn, were apparently kept out of the loop about what exactly Flynn and Kislyak discussed.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the conversations between Flynn and Kislyak told The Post that Flynn's communications were &quot;incidentally collected&quot; as part of a top-secret intelligence report on Kislyak. After they reviewed the report, which has since been shared with Obama and Trump, McGahn and others acted quickly to warn Trump's senior staff about what they saw.\n\nMcGahn told Trump that Flynn's communications may have violated an obscure US law that forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments against US interests, according to a separate Washington Post report on Tuesday.\n\nIt's not yet clear why Flynn, who was appointed as national security adviser with little experience in international relations, was having those conversations in the first place.\n\nSince the Trump campaign, Flynn has reportedly developed close ties with top officials in Russia, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and has been paid tens of thousands of dollars in fees by Russian companies.\n\nBut Flynn's resignation on Monday came amid a broader debate over Trump's ties to Russia, and it adds to a cloud of controversy around Trump's own attitude toward Russian meddling in the election. Trump has insisted on several occasions that the intelligence community has not reached a conclusion about whether Russian hackers sought to boost Trump's campaign, even though the intelligence community has reported the consensus view that it was Russia.\n\nDemocrats, in particular, have been vocally critical of Flynn's conversations, and of Trump's defense of Flynn.\n\n&quot;The speed at which we're learning about all of this is absolutely breathtaking,&quot; Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Monday. &quot;I think we ought to slow down.&quot;\n\n&quot;You can't have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,&quot; said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. &quot;This in the wake of what we know about Russian hacking and election interference. It is of profound concern, and there is a need for a serious and thorough investigation.&quot;\n\nBut Trump has yet to provide any details about what he believes Flynn discussed with Kislyak.\n\n&quot;I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right,&quot; Trump said on Wednesday. &quot;He was just doing his job. The thing is he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me.&quot;\n\nWhat is the Logan Act?\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said that Flynn did not discuss sanctions with Kislyak, and that he did not recall discussing the US's decision to expel Russian diplomats from the US in retaliation for the election-related hacking.\n\nWhen The Post first reported on Flynn's conversations in February, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak on December 28, the day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for election-related hacking. The sanctions were imposed in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision not to retaliate after the US expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shuttered two Russian facilities in the US in response to the hacking of US political organizations and leaking sensitive information to WikiLeaks.\n\nBut Spicer later walked back that statement, saying that Flynn and Kislyak may have had a conversation, but that it was &quot;not a discussion of sanctions.&quot;\n\nThe Department of Justice informed the White House counsel on January 26 that Flynn was not entirely forthcoming about his conversations with Kislyak, according to The Post's first report. A day later, Pence learned that Flynn's conversations may have broken the law and expressed his concerns to Flynn, who assured him they did not.\n\nThe White House said in a statement last week that it had &quot;no idea&quot; about the true nature of the Flynn-Kislyak conversations, but the Post's report on Tuesday said that Trump knew Flynn misled Pence about their contents. Trump did not ask Flynn about it, however, until the Monday before he was fired, the report said.\n\nA person close to the White House told The Post that White House officials were &quot;stunned&quot; to learn how far along the Justice Department investigation was.\n\nAfter The Post's report on Tuesday, which said that Trump had known about Flynn's conversations since January 26, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN that Flynn had Trump's &quot;full confidence.&quot;\n\nBut Flynn resigned after a new report published Tuesday night said that the Justice Department had informed the White House that Flynn could be subject to blackmail because of his false statements about his conversations.\n\nFlynn has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, but until recently, the investigation into his activities was limited to whether he had violated federal law by failing to properly disclose payments from Russia and Turkey.\n\nThe federal law that prohibits US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments against US interests, known as the Logan Act, is rarely enforced, but Flynn's conversations with Kislyak could have put him in violation.\n\nThe Logan Act was passed in 1799 to prevent citizens from trying to influence US foreign policy by making private deals with foreign governments. Only two people have been prosecuted under the act: in 1803, when a Kentucky farmer wrote a newspaper article in which he called on Americans to refuse to buy British goods, and in 1852, when an Indiana farmer tried to help Mexican Americans recover lost land after the Mexican-American War. Neither were convicted.\n\nWhen asked about the Logan Act in March, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said it was a &quot;silly&quot; law.\n\n&quot;I don't know what the intent was of the Logan Act, but the law is a little bit silly and a little outdated,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd say that his actions -- not just the reporting of the incident -- but also the following day, Flynn made clear that it was inaccurate.&quot;\n\nBut one of the US's top legal experts on the Logan Act says that Flynn's actions may be illegal.\n\n&quot;The issue is a very serious one,&quot; Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law and a CNN contributor, told CNN on Tuesday. &quot;This wasn't just a slip of the tongue. This wasn't just a statement to a reporter. This was something that, according to reports, he discussed with other senior Trump administration officials. It was something that the vice president of the United States apparently thought was serious enough to bring to the attention of the President himself.\n\n&quot;It's not just about the Logan Act. It's about everything else that is swirling around this administration,&quot; Vladeck said. &quot;If there is any evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russian officials or representatives to help swing the election, then we have another entirely different kettle of fish on our hands.&quot;\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.]" time="0.700"><properties><property name="score" value="0.07545974966666666" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.07545975&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.07545975

And yes, it was about the velocity of execution - but there was a lot more to it.\n\n\n\nThe idea was that when you learned a piece you should practise it very slowly, in order to get the fingering, phrasing, pedalling etc right. But once you could play the piece perfectly slowly, you needed to practise it more quickly, in order to make sure you got the fingering, phrasing and pedalling absolutely perfect at the quicker speed.\n\n\n\nCzerny practised every day for hours, he wrote over two thousand pieces for piano (many are now completely forgotten) and he was a friend of Beethoven and of the pianist and composer Franz Liszt. The School of Velocity actually explains a lot about Czerny and Liszt's tastes in music. It wasn't so much about technique - though obviously they wanted music that was extremely difficult to play, and music that sounded good at every speed. But it was also about a music that is rhythmically and intellectually complex. Music that sounded fine, and was fascinating, at any speed.\n\n\n\nIn the 19th century, composers and performers used to refer to a piece that was difficult to play as being 'virtuoso' music. Today, people are much more likely to say that a piece is 'virtuoso' if the performer is a brilliant soloist. There was an important link between the two ideas, but there was also a big difference.\n\n\n\nA piece might be virtuoso in the sense that it was musically hard to play. But if a soloist could play the piece perfectly well, then there was nothing virtuosic about it at all. You could hear that it was musically good - but it wouldn't sound difficult.\n\n\n\nI remember a performance of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring that I saw in the early 1970s, when I was a teenager. It was performed by a major orchestra with some top conductors, and it was an extremely well-rehearsed performance. It was also a pretty stodgy performance - there was no electricity, and hardly any excitement. It was an impressive feat, but it was also dull. The most memorable thing about the performance was the way the audience reacted to it - the British critics, who thought they were being sophisticated, sneered and scoffed, and the audience members, who hadn't really understood what they had just seen, shouted and cheered.\n\n\n\nSo I know very well that a piece can be virtuoso in the sense that it is musically exciting - and yet it can also be virtuoso in the sense that it is technically extremely hard to play. I also know that the relationship between the two is not straightforward.\n\n\n\nA well-played piece can be musically exciting, and yet the performer can miss out on all the virtuoso bits - they can play it slowly, without pedalling, and without any expression, and without making any effort to bring out the music. If you think about it, that can't be right. If a piece is technically easy to play - and musically boring - then it isn't really a virtuoso piece. It may be musically good - but it's not virtuoso.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot more to virtuosity than just playing a piece well. And you can tell that from some of the best music ever written.\n\n\n\nSo Liszt and Czerny's criteria for virtuoso music aren't the same as the criteria for 'musical virtuoso' music. To them, it was also about a sense of musical excitement. It was about a piece that sounded good at any speed - and which sounded good whether you played it fast or slow. In the 19th century, that was what virtuosity was about.\n\n\n\nThat's why they liked Liszt and Wagner so much. And that's why I like them too.\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt; Music &amp; Vision home A musician's life &gt;&gt;\n\n]" time="0.385"><properties><property name="score" value="0.10537536" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Himawari-8 is a Japanese geostationary weather satellite developed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). It is the second in the Himawari series of satellites, following Himawari-7 which launched in October 2013.\n\nLaunch and orbital configuration [ edit ]\n\nHimawari-8 was launched by Arianespace using an Ariane 5ES carrier rocket flying from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. The launch occurred at 22:09 UTC on 2 October 2014, and marked Arianespace's sixth launch of the year and the second Ariane 5ES launch of the year.[3] It was the 70th Ariane 5 launch overall.\n\nThe satellite was built by Mitsubishi Electric, and is based on the DS-2000 satellite bus. It is equipped with two solar arrays, with a span of 33.9 metres (111 ft). It is expected to operate for ten years, although the JMA is required to maintain it for only five.

Thanks for sharing. My husband and I have talked about buying an old truck and refurbishing it. We are very practical people. So, with all of the families who need assistance with their old truck, this is a great idea! My husband does a lot of heavy construction work and we have seen old trucks that people have used as a source of income. My husband has thought about starting a truck repair business to take in used trucks. They do have to be restored a little bit, so he thought he could take some of the load off people and help them out with the money they need. He has thought about all of the used trucks that he sees in people's driveways and knows that they will never sell them because of how much work they are. We actually came across a pretty decent truck last weekend. The only thing wrong with it was that it had been used as a dump truck. It had a couple of huge dump bed holes in the bottom of it. We checked the engine and it runs good. We thought we could buy it and have it fixed up. It had low miles on it, so we thought it would be a good buy. I really thought my husband was going to buy it, but then he was thinking about all of the things that could go wrong with it. He would have had to drive it, so he was thinking about that. He also thought about all of the equipment and the backhoe and such that he would have had to buy if he bought it. My husband is a very smart man and he knew that it would be a lot of work, so we didn't even make an offer.\n\n\n\nI do know that I would love to find a nice truck and fix it up and then donate it to a needy family. I don't know what kind of license you need to operate a truck in your state, but I would like to look into that. I don't think we would charge for the use of the truck. I think we would just want the families to know that we would not be calling on them and checking up on them. I would want the truck to be used for transportation. We would probably work with a nonprofit, so that they would have to be approved to use the truck. That is the only way that I could think of to do it. We are very cautious about where we would donate the truck. My husband and I don't know how long we would have it. We would donate it for a specific time period. We are pretty smart people and we don't need the truck. We know that we would be able to get more than the price we paid for the truck out of it. We could use the money for other things that we are doing.\n\n\n\nMy husband has thought about finding a newer truck that doesn't need to be fixed up. He has thought about putting a little addition on the back to hold a bed. The bed would be the only part of the truck that needed to be fixed up. We have talked about taking this truck and fixing it up and then donating it. I am not sure how we would go about it though.\n\n\n\nThe truck that we saw last weekend is worth at least $3000.00. It has a V8 engine. It does need to be fixed up a little bit, but it is not worth that much money. We looked it up and it was only worth $2500.00. We could probably get it for $2000.00 if we fixed it up. It has not been registered in years, so we would have to get that straightened out. It has power windows, which is really neat. It has a sunroof. It is a really nice truck and it is in good condition. It is not the kind of truck that is really worth buying and fixing up. My husband thought that we could buy it, but I didn't want to go that far. My husband is not used to looking at vehicles like this. I know that he could use it for the business. My husband is a contractor, so he could use it to haul tools and such around.\n\n\n\nIf you can help us figure out what kind of license we need to operate the truck in our state, we would really appreciate it. I am going to look online and see if I can find something out. It would be a lot of work, but it would be worth it. We just don't want the families to take advantage of us. I don't know how we could help with that.\n\n\n\nWe would be willing to spend $500.00 on the truck. It needs some minor work. It is still a nice truck though. We thought we could add a dump bed to it. The bed is the only part that needs to be fixed up. It has a roll down door, so we could even use it to haul things around. It is a great truck.\n\n\n\nI would love to talk to you about this some more. My husband has already done a lot of the research on this. He thinks it would be a great project for us to take on. We have had a lot of health problems lately, so we have not had the time to really look into it.\n\n\n\nI really hope that you can help us. This is an exciting opportunity. I know that you will be able to help us figure out how to operate a truck in our state. I know that we will be able to get the license. We will probably need to get a company name, so that we can register the truck. We are looking forward to talking with you about this.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary]" time="0.514"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0008264823" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[This week, Leonie and Rachel are doing things they have not done before: reading a thriller with their daughters. While the girls are out of school, they take a break from picture books to read some chapters of THE SCIENCE OF HUGGING with their respective five and three year olds. With its lovely illustrations and captivating illustrations of animals, trees, insects, and a variety of other things, the book provides a great introduction to science.\n\nIt was an absolute joy to see the girls absorb the information, ask the right questions, and share their thoughts with their moms about what they were reading.\n\nTo learn more about the book, read on for our interview with the author, Johanna Kindvall.\n\nDid you have a childhood favorite book?\n\nAs a child, I loved the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I also loved the animal books by J.H.Hutchinson, such as \u201cAre you an Elephant?\u201d and \u201cAre you a Bear?\u201d\n\nWhat is your book about?\n\nIn this book, I show the science of hugging. Hugging is the act of embracing someone in a caring way. Hugging is a common way to express caring and affection. This book discusses many different types of hugging, from the ways that trees and flowers hug each other, to the ways that animals hug each other. I also discuss why we hug, how hugging can help our health, and the different feelings that we experience while we hug.\n\nTell us about a typical day in your writing life?\n\nI write every day. If I am not writing, I am thinking about writing. I have a lot of ideas for new books. I think about ideas and jot down notes. Sometimes I write at my computer, other times I write in my journal. I usually write from 8am-12pm, and then I go back to work.\n\nWhy did you write the book?\n\nI wanted to write a book about hugging. I was thinking about what kind of information about hugging would be most interesting to share with children, and I realized that we really do not know a lot about the science of hugging.\n\nDo you have an interesting story about writing the book?\n\nIt was so fun to illustrate this book, because I was able to illustrate a variety of different types of hugging. When I made the book I tried to hug a tree for the cover illustration. The hardest hug to illustrate was a bear hug. I had to really think about how I could draw a bear hug, and how I would express that the bear was hugging with his claws.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of the book?\n\nI love my cover illustration, because it shows so many different types of hugging. I also really like the science of hugging pages, because I was able to show the different ways that science can be used to understand hugs.\n\nWhat is your favorite picture in the book?\n\nI like the two pages that show how different types of hugging affect our bodies. I was able to illustrate the heart and lungs, and it was a lot of fun to make those illustrations.\n\nWhere can people purchase your book?\n\nThis book can be purchased on Amazon.\n\nWho is your favorite author?\n\nI really enjoy reading books by Linda Sue Park and Peter Brown.\n\nThanks to Johanna for sharing about her book.]" time="0.386"><properties><property name="score" value="0.15002033" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[View Full Version : one of the local clubs @ PATM\n\nshane diesel\n\nwell i am for the most part done with the patm club area that i am working on , with that said i decided to use some parts i have had and build a club one of the club i was with for 4 years http://www.southerntireburners.com/ not sure where they have landed but the other club i was with for 5 years http://www.snappin-turtle-customs.com/ i am still a member at snappin turtle customs so if ya'll ever come to central florida stop in and visit . here is a little something i built for them http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0318.jpg http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0321.jpg http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0320.jpg http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0323.jpg http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0322.jpg i know i am missing a few pictures , when i get a chance i will go back and get them , there are 2 if not 3 more boards that i built them also one is there snappin turtle one and the other is a walking turtle or should i say turtle that is walking\n\nhttp://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0325.jpg http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0326.jpg http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0327.jpg http://i535.photobucket.com/albums/ee351/jdmchristy072/custom%20rear%20toy/turtle/IMG_0328.jpg well i guess this will be the end of my building patm stuff if ya'll never know where patm is just remember it is between cleveland and detroit michigan . well have a great night or day]" time="1.441"><properties><property name="score" value="0.2090198" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[2 5 5 5\n\nCan't use in my kitchen- Need a work space I got this item as a gift and never really used it.

Another workshop, which explored the different genres of classical music, demonstrated how the young people could use their creative thinking to connect with other styles of music. The young people also engaged in philosophical discussions about music and life.

The patients have required hospitalization and one patient has died.\n\nPossible E. coli contamination in bagged and chopped romaine lettuce has sickened at least 15 people in NY and New Jersey, according to the CDC.\n\nThat's what can be expected in the aftermath of E. coli outbreaks that have been linked to fresh produce, says Lawrence Goodridge, director of the Washington State Department of Health's Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Program. &quot;I think in some cases, if you don't have irrigation, you have to go through the issue of what's the most you can do&quot;.]" time="0.425"><properties><property name="score" value="0.03812076" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.03812076&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.03812076

Milrod, Ph.D.\n\nRecreational gambling, especially casino gambling, is a growing and significant industry in the United States. A growing number of families engage in some form of gambling as a leisure activity. A sizeable number of families visit a casino at least once a year. Increasing numbers of families engage in forms of gambling that do not require visits to a casino, but do require some type of Internet or computer connection. Families that are not recreational gamblers are likely to include at least one person who is a gambler, a gambler who also functions in some other major role in the family, such as as a spouse, parent, sibling, or grandparent. Therefore, even if gambling is not a regular family leisure activity, it is a part of life for a significant number of families.\n\nGiven that, how does the gambling industry want the public to think about gambling and its impact on families? How should the public be thinking about it? What impact does it have on families? What are some of the causes and symptoms of gambling-related problems?\n\nThe 2005 National Gambling Impact Study Commission, the most recent of a series of gambling impact studies, reported that the number of people who engage in some form of gambling each year has increased since the last study. In the most recent study, it was estimated that approximately 21% of the adult population has engaged in some form of gambling at least once during the course of a year.\n\nThe study found that while the majority of the population gambles for entertainment purposes, a smaller but significant minority gambles for money and may be at risk for developing a gambling problem.\n\nThe study also reported that most people are either unaware of the nature of pathological gambling or misperceive its prevalence. A significant minority of the population does not believe that pathological gambling exists or that it exists only in a relatively small percentage of the population.\n\nEven in cases where the public recognizes that gambling is a problem for some, the impact of gambling on family members is often minimized. Therefore, the topic of gambling and its impact on family members has become a popular topic among researchers and is the subject of several studies.\n\nFor example, Blaszczynski and McConaghy reported that most of the relatives of pathological gamblers and problem gamblers had been affected by the gambling and had been directly affected by the adverse financial consequences.\n\nThey also reported that the relatives of pathological gamblers had significantly more dysfunction in their lives than the relatives of the problem gamblers. Additionally, they found that there was a significantly greater prevalence of gambling in the relatives of the pathological gamblers.\n\nWilliams and colleagues also reported that pathological gambling had a negative impact on the families of pathological gamblers. In that study, the spouses of the pathological gamblers were most likely to report problems in their marriage. These problems included financial difficulties, difficulties with communication, and issues with dealing with the gambling.\n\nGiven that, we might ask ourselves how does this impact families?\n\nIn terms of family interactions and dynamics, gambling can affect families in many ways. Family members may be affected in different ways. Family members may also be affected at different levels. For example, some family members may not be impacted very much at all. Others may be affected more severely. Family members may also be affected in a way that is either beneficial or detrimental. For example, they may be affected in a way that is not particularly harmful to them, but does cause harm to others.\n\nLet's examine the impact of gambling on family members in more detail. First, let's take a look at the general impact on family members.\n\nThe Impact of Gambling on Family Members\n\nSome of the impact on family members may be similar to the impact that other problem behaviors, such as substance abuse, have on families. However, some aspects of the impact are also unique to gambling. Let's take a look at both the similarities and the differences.\n\nGeneral Impact\n\nIn general, the effects of gambling on family members can be broadly categorized into four major areas: financial impact, emotional impact, environmental impact, and cultural impact. These areas, and the individual effects within each area, are described below.\n\nFinancial Impact\n\nMost families in the United States struggle with money issues at some time during the course of their lives. Financial concerns can affect a family's ability to deal with other problems. They can also cause problems in and of themselves.\n\nWhen financial concerns arise as a result of gambling, family members may need to sacrifice other financial needs to meet the demands of the gambler. For example, the gambler may require family members to fund a large portion of his or her gambling activities. This may require the family to make difficult decisions about which expenses to cut back on or to borrow money.\n\nFamilies may also face financial difficulties as a result of the gambling of a member. For example, if a family member incurs debts or otherwise incurs financial problems as a result of gambling, the other family members may need to cover his or her debts. This can be costly.\n\nCultural Impact\n\nGambling in America has a long history. This history has influenced American society and culture in many ways. One way it has influenced American society is through the creation of &quot;gaming&quot; communities. These communities, which are primarily located in the western part of the United States, are based on gambling.\n\nGambling as a cultural activity has evolved over time, and has become a part of our culture and entertainment culture. As a result, there is now a certain level of expectation in American culture about recreational gambling.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nSome people believe that gambling in a casino is a more &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;controlled&quot; environment than recreational gambling in the home. While this may be true, there are some dangers to this type of environment. Casinos can sometimes be a location where crime and violence occur. Families who engage in this form of gambling, then, can be negatively impacted in a variety of ways by the environment in which they gamble.\n\nEmotional Impact\n\nEmotions play an important role in all aspects of life, including in families. The emotional impact of gambling is both obvious and subtle. It is both dramatic and subtle. Families and family members may react emotionally to the gambling of a family member.\n\nFamilies may also react emotionally in response to a gambling-related problem. Some family members may respond with fear or anxiety about the problem. Others may respond with shame, guilt, or embarrassment.\n\nThe emotional impact of gambling on a family can be quite extensive. Some family members may be quite negatively affected. Others may be less affected. Family members who are more affected by a gambling problem may, in turn, cause other family members to become more negatively affected.\n\nIn other words, the gambling problem of one family member can have a negative]" time="0.846"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0078391577" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[20.12.2010\n\nLaser 4.0, EUROFORUM \u2013 The role of innovation in a period of crisis: Claudio Dematt\xe9: Online innovation: Increasing competition in the global economy requires flexible strategies.\n\nDuring the 7th edition of Laser 4.0, EUROFORUM \u2013 The role of innovation in a period of crisis, which took place on the 18th of November in Venice, Claudio Dematt\xe9 discussed about \u201conline innovation\u201d, a concept increasingly adopted by companies with the aim to develop new business models.\n\n\n\nClaudio Dematt\xe9 is Associate Professor of Management and Strategy at LUISS University. He has been coordinating the Communication Technology Laboratory at LUISS since 2007 and he has been a member of the Telecommunication Research Centre (C.T.R.) since 2008.\n\n\n\nClaudio Dematt\xe9 is the author of articles on the topics of innovation, high technology and competition and he has also published several books.\n\n\n\nHis latest book, \u201cAlla ricerca della tecnologia dei miracoli\u201d, addresses the issue of competition in the information technology sector, analysing, in particular, the evolution of the competitive structure, new forms of alliances and companies\u2019 business models.\n\n\n\nDuring his lecture, Claudio Dematt\xe9 presented the results of his research on the technology sector, which demonstrate that the use of new technologies has not been a determining factor in the company\u2019s performance in the last ten years, in particular as regards innovation.\n\n\n\nThis approach highlights the importance of developing innovative strategies based on collaborative alliances, and on an analysis of the local and international competitive scenario. The various steps of this analysis have the aim to understand how competitive pressure is affected by local and international factors, and to gain an overview of the innovative strategies adopted by the main players.\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the way in which innovations are being developed and commercialised in different sectors, Dematt\xe9 carried out an analysis of the companies that are among the most innovative worldwide, together with their respective characteristics and with their distribution in different sectors.\n\n\n\nThe importance of online innovation is increasing. Analysing the phenomenon of e-commerce in detail, Dematt\xe9 explained that the traditional retail models are losing ground to the new approaches and the new technology is driving companies towards a new vision of how to develop new products and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of the Internet has turned the e-commerce market into an increasingly competitive field, in which \u201cfollower strategies\u201d, such as the launch of specific websites and of niche products, have become more common.\n\n\n\nOnline innovation is therefore a reality, however in order to make the most of this phenomenon companies have to develop a \u201cstrategic vision\u201d of the e-commerce market.\n\n\n\nThe lecture of Claudio Dematt\xe9 was followed by a panel discussion in which, among the other speakers, Giulio Tremonti, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Economy and Finances, took part.]" time="0.383"><properties><property name="score" value="1.7553985" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[A man has been charged with the murder of a teenage girl whose remains were found near the A130 on Christmas Day.\n\nThe body of 14-year-old Bijal Patel was found at around 2pm in a wooded area in Thorpe Marriott, near the A130 interchange.\n\nBijal Patel, 14, was murdered in December (Picture: Archant)\n\nShe had last been seen on December 21 at a bus stop in the Mildenhall area, and a post-mortem examination found she died of multiple injuries.\n\nA 45-year-old man has now been charged with murder and will appear in court tomorrow.\n\nInspector Sam Cavale said: \u2018This is a very tragic and upsetting incident that has caused much distress to Bijal\u2019s family, the community and local emergency services.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d like to thank those people for their help and support.

State and local agencies, not the CDC, are responsible for drug-treatment programs, policing, and other areas of opioid response. And when it comes to administering Medicaid, states also have the lead role.\n\nFor this reason, CDC's success hinges on the agencies it funds, especially state health departments.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest obstacles to reducing opioid overdose deaths, and how CDC can address them.\n\nStates can't take on the opioid epidemic alone\n\nAmerica has a crisis on its hands. Opioid overdoses killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, and a July report from the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis noted that overdose deaths are &quot;expected to keep rising.&quot;\n\n&quot;We have to figure out a way to prevent the unintended consequences of our good intentions,&quot; said D'Onofrio.\n\nIn other words, the public-health responses to the opioid epidemic, from addiction treatment to education campaigns, are having a variety of unintended consequences.\n\nTo address them, experts say the CDC needs to support the state and local agencies, such as health departments and medical schools, that will be at the front lines of the response.\n\n&quot;CDC has a responsibility to provide resources and expertise to state and local health departments,&quot; said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).\n\nVolkow said the agency should focus on supporting states with developing evidence-based strategies for reducing opioid overdoses, expanding treatment, and improving pain management.\n\n&quot;We know that there are tools out there,&quot; she said. &quot;But it takes the CDC and NIDA working together to identify them, develop them, and help distribute them.&quot;\n\nIt's not just about access to treatment\n\nIn the midst of the worst drug crisis in US history, it's easy to believe that all the country needs is more treatment to curb opioid addiction.\n\nBut experts say it's not just about access to treatment.\n\n&quot;The CDC has to provide help to states and communities in building up their capacity to respond to this epidemic,&quot; said Dr. Jon Zibbell, chief of the Bureau of Epidemiology at the Pennsylvania Department of Health.\n\nTo do that, Zibbell said the agency needs to create a national, standardized system to track the crisis \u2014 including the spread of heroin, fentanyl, and prescription drugs.\n\nCDC also needs to provide guidelines for evidence-based treatments, Zibbell said, and train a workforce to deliver them.\n\nZibbell said that the opioid crisis is different from previous drug epidemics, like HIV and hepatitis, because it is widespread, affecting every age group and gender. And unlike previous drug epidemics, it is not driven by a specific drug like cocaine or crack, but by the opioid class of drugs.\n\nSo, unlike other drug crises, Zibbell said, the opioid epidemic is not tied to any particular place or population, or the supply of a certain drug.\n\nAnd because the crisis has been going on for so long, the country needs CDC support to build up local expertise and respond.\n\n&quot;There's no way around it,&quot; Zibbell said. &quot;The best thing for CDC to do is support local, state, and territorial health departments.&quot;\n\nFocusing on the health of the general public is also important\n\nThe opioid epidemic has put a spotlight on the harm opioids do to people who use them.

It is a small store that seems to only have seating for about 15 people and is a bit cramped. The owners do not serve any alcohol, but you are allowed to bring your own and have it with your food. The store has been around for a while, but in the past year has added a weekend lunch menu. I came here for their Open Mic night on Thursday night. I found out about this Open Mic night from OpenMic.com . This website has a list of all the Open Mic nights around the world, which is cool because I go to a lot of them in NYC. There are three things that make me fall in love with a store, yummy chocolates, yummy food, and a community vibe. This store has two of those things. When you walk into this store you instantly get a chocolate vibe. The store has a plethora of chocolate options, which are amazing, and they even have a chocolate museum (open only for select times). I just ordered a few chocolate covered truffles and some chocolates for my family for Christmas.The owner of the store, Bruce, came to talk to us about his store, and the Open Mic. I asked him what is their favorite pie. He said it is the coconut cream pie, which they make fresh daily, so it is the best one. I also asked him why they don't serve alcohol. He told me that his wife does not like alcohol, and since they have three kids, they have to make sure to keep it G rated. This is cool since I am the same way. I like having fun with my friends, but I don't want my children exposed to things they shouldn't be exposed to.The Open Mic is run by Bruce's daughter Liz. She has done a great job at getting people to come to this event. I was surprised that this place was packed when I came. Usually Open Mic nights I go to are either dead, or have a small turnout. When I went to the Open Mic at Riverview Tavern , I was the only person there. That night Bruce was performing. He was singing Christmas songs with his guitar. He is a very talented musician. He can sing, and play the guitar, and is a great songwriter. He played a lot of good Christmas songs, but did not play anything I knew. Some people I know came by and I talked to them for a bit, while listening to Bruce play. I was not planning on staying long since I have been to a lot of Open Mic nights, but after a while, I was having so much fun listening to the people performing, that I decided to stay. I also talked to Liz, and Bruce's wife about the food and store.Bruce and Liz had a table set up with various pies and cakes to try. There were over 20 pies and cakes to try. I really wanted to try them all, but I was saving myself for a special birthday celebration later that night.I got to try some of their dessert plates. They had vanilla bean cake, orange cake, apple pie, and cream cheese squares. I really liked their vanilla bean cake. It was moist, and not dry like other vanilla cakes I have had. The cake had a vanilla flavor, but was not over powering. The orange cake had an orange flavor that was not over powering either. I really liked this cake as well. I am not sure which one I liked the best. I am also not sure which cake was made at the store, and which was not. All of their desserts looked amazing!The music that night was great! There was a lot of talent. Everyone was amazing, and I wish I had taken some pictures. I was too busy listening and enjoying myself. One person, Tom, stood out to me. He had a great voice, and his rendition of I just called to say I love you was a great choice. I also loved when he did a song with a bit of a rock vibe to it. He has great range, and is an amazing performer.After listening to the performers, it was time to go. I was very full and the pie was just too much to handle. Liz came by and asked if I wanted to have another piece of pie. I said yes and took home a piece of their chocolate creme pie, and a slice of the coconut cream pie. Their chocolate pie was amazing. It was rich and moist and tasted just like a Hershey's chocolate bar. They only had one slice of the coconut cream pie left, so I took it home. It was also amazing. It was so creamy and tasted like coconut. I don't even like coconut, but this pie was so good! It had a bit of a gelatin texture to it. This was one of the best pies I have ever had. I really love all of the pies I had here, and will be back for more.

Verified Purchase This jacket is lightweight, well designed and with plenty of pockets. The Goretex fabric does its job as it has to and seems to be durable.

The fabric has a nice 'stretch' in it so you can put it on easily even if it is a little bit large. The length of the sleeves and the torso is excellent, as I have shorter arms.\n\nI would highly recommend this jacket as a light duty waterproof.

The sleeves are long enough, and the pockets are deep enough, even when wearing gloves. The fabric seems to be very hard wearing and well made.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Lightweight and comfortable Verified Purchase I got this because it was described as 'running short', which seemed to be a reference to the short length, as opposed to it being for a runner. I wanted a wind/waterproof jacket which could be worn as a 'trousers-coat' on its own or over my normal jacket, so I was quite happy with the short length.\n\nIt is extremely lightweight and, despite its short length, very comfortable. It has two large pockets on the front and one in the centre, plus two pockets inside the front and two on the upper arms.\n\nI haven't worn it in really wet weather, but in light drizzle it seems to work well. It is obviously waterproof, but perhaps not warm enough to wear on its own in very cold or wet weather. However, worn over my normal coat it does provide adequate insulation for light rain or windy weather.\n\nI would certainly recommend this jacket, especially if you don't need it for extreme weather.\n\n4.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy and waterproof Verified Purchase Bought for my daughter to keep in her bag, so she would always have it with her, incase the weather turns, the jacket is light and waterproof, so no worries about her getting wet. The jacket looks smart and has plenty of room to put in extra layers underneath.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Very Good for the price Verified Purchase I am very pleased with this item.

Rolling Stone magazine, for instance, recently included the Stones in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, placing them at No. 13. Their influence in rock music is undeniable, especially considering that the Rolling Stones are one of the most commercially successful bands in history, selling more than 200 million albums worldwide. In addition, they have 12 number one albums and 18 number one singles. With countless hit songs under their belt, it is no wonder that this famous band has been able to attract hundreds of thousands of fans to their recent concert dates.

The band formed in 1962 and is still touring today. The band members are Charlie Watts, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, and Ronnie Wood. These five individuals, who had a very interesting start, are considered one of the most successful rock bands of all time. They have sold more than 200 million albums worldwide. They are also credited as one of the greatest live acts in music history.\n\nThe Rolling Stones began their career as a pop and R&amp;B cover band. They also incorporated jazz elements in their music. They achieved worldwide fame with their hit single \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction.\u201d It has since become one of the most recognizable and classic rock songs in music history. They followed the song with the equally popular \u201cPaint it Black\u201d in 1966. Other great songs in the 1960s include \u201cGet Off My Cloud,\u201d \u201c19th Nervous Breakdown,\u201d \u201cMother\u2019s Little Helper,\u201d \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash,\u201d and \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want.\u201d\n\nFollowing a lengthy break from touring, The Rolling Stones returned to the road in 1982. In 1986, the band played what is believed to be their final show at the Altamont Speedway in California. The concert has since become a notorious case study in cultural history and has been regarded as the moment that led to the end of the \u201cSummer of Love\u201d in the United States.\n\nThe band\u2019s success was not limited to its early years. The Rolling Stones have released numerous hits throughout the 1990s and 2000s, including \u201cStart Me Up,\u201d \u201cBrown Sugar,\u201d \u201cWild Horses,\u201d \u201cYou Got Me Rocking,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t You Hear Me Knocking,\u201d \u201cMiss You,\u201d \u201cPaint It Black,\u201d \u201cHonky Tonk Woman,\u201d and \u201cUnder My Thumb.\u201d In 2004, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Rolling Stones remain a popular act on the road. They have been on tour in recent years and have scheduled more concert dates for 2016. They will be playing the Starplex Pavilion in Dallas, the Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre in Englewood, the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, and the Sleep Train Amphitheatre in Chula Vista. They have been invited to play in arenas, stadiums, and even stadiums as a guest band. They have won several awards, including 12 Grammy awards. The band has had many successful albums, including \u201cSticky Fingers,\u201d \u201cTattoo You,\u201d \u201cSome Girls,\u201d \u201cBeggars Banquet,\u201d and \u201cExile on Main St.\u201d\n\nThe Rolling Stones are certainly one of the most important rock bands in music history.

It also means Government collects a little less revenue.&quot; Finance Minister Bill English said.\n\nRNZ Business Editor Rob Hosking said the measure has been extended, but the new land tax will not come into effect until 2018.\n\n&quot;Land tax will only apply to 'under-occupied' homes, defined as any house or apartment that's unoccupied for more than six months of the year, in which case the owner will have to pay tax on it as though they were renting it out,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;At the moment there are approximately 41,000 vacant houses in Auckland - and that's without counting holiday homes, which would push that number higher.&quot;\n\nBanks and real estate companies are predicting prices will continue to rise.\n\n&quot;The Auckland housing market has been in a state of severe imbalance for some time now, with demand outstripping supply, which is pushing house prices higher and making it difficult for first-home buyers to enter the market,&quot; said Peter Thompson, head of New Zealand for ANZ.\n\n&quot;The [bright line] tax has been a step in the right direction, and should help to moderate house price inflation over time.\n\n&quot;But the tax is unlikely to have a significant impact on the market over the next 12 months.

This issue also features a special tour of Paul Heyman\u2019s home, his office, and everything in between, and a countdown of the most brutal action figures ever. For more details, click here.\n\nInnovative Elimination Chamber Plans Posted by: Eve at 03:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow WWF News | WENN | Sports Illustrated WWE.com announced the first match in the history of the Elimination Chamber will take place at No Way Out on February 17th. Four of SmackDown\u2019s top stars will participate in the first ever match for the Elimination Chamber. Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, Edge, and Eddie Guerrero will compete for the right to face Triple H for the WWE Championship at Wrestlemania. The first ever Elimination Chamber will take place inside the Raw set. The Elimination Chamber consists of six chain-linked pods that will enclose each of the Superstars. The structure is approximately 60 feet high, 35 feet wide and weighs about 15,000 pounds. The pods are three feet wide and six feet tall and are composed of steel. The pods will be locked in the ringside area of the Raw set by two large hydraulic cams. Each pod contains a television monitor that will allow the Superstars to monitor what is happening in the match. The pods will be illuminated to allow fans at home to see the action inside. The pods will also be accessible by large trap doors which will be controlled by a floor director, ensuring that when they are opened, the Superstars inside the pods will not be tipped over. The Elimination Chamber was designed by WWE.com editor R.D. Reynolds and a team of engineers. The concept was first suggested to WWE by R.D. Reynolds in December, 2001. \u201cWe were sitting in the WWE.com war room discussing ideas for No Way Out,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI knew the Elimination Chamber match was a very real possibility, and I suggested to Vince McMahon that we do something to make it stand out. Vince thought the idea was great, and here we are.\u201d \u201cWhat was great about the opportunity,\u201d says Reynold, \u201cis that we were not just asked to build something. We were given the freedom to really create a unique environment that could provide for the best viewing experience for our fans. I knew what the WWE was looking for, so the team worked very closely to create a structure that would support the weight of the pods, the Superstars, and the hydraulics while allowing them to easily get out of the pods and to safety.\u201d \u201cWe want this Elimination Chamber to be the best the WWE has ever put on,\u201d says WWE Production Coordinator Andy Shepard. \u201cAnd we are confident that we will accomplish this with the design we have put together. We have tested the pods, and the ability to raise and lower them into the ring. There will be no problem with getting the Superstars in and out of the pods. It\u2019s an amazing and innovative design.\u201d The pods will be constructed in the Raw set by R.D. Reynolds and the WWE.com Engineering team. The pods will be lifted from the ringside area of the set to the ceiling, where the ringside crew will place them into the chains. \u201cThe pods are surprisingly light,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work for one man to lift them, but with six men, it is very possible. And the ringside crew will not have any problem.\u201d \u201cWhen the pods are dropped,\u201d says Shepard, \u201cthey will remain exactly where we want them to. It\u2019s not like they will fall from the ceiling. They will be perfectly placed to complete the structure.\u201d The Elimination Chamber will be a steel structure approximately 15 feet high. \u201cThe pods and the chamber will be constructed of steel,\u201d says R.D. Reynolds, \u201cwhich makes it even more amazing that the Superstars will be able to lift it from the ringside area of the set to the ceiling. It is no easy feat.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just the weight of the pods and structure that makes it difficult,\u201d says Shepard. \u201cWe also have to consider the ceiling of the Raw set. It is about 20 feet from the floor to the ceiling. So, the Superstars will not be able to simply walk the pods to the ceiling. There will be a few creative ways to get the pods up there.\u201d WWE Production Coordinator Andy Shepard has worked with the company since 1992. He has worked on the crew for several pay-per-views and TV shows, including ECW and SmackDown. \u201cThis is going to be an exciting match,\u201d says Shepard. \u201cIt will be something completely different from what the WWE Universe has ever seen. The fans at home and in the arena are going to be blown away. I know that is the goal of the WWE and everyone on the crew.

It's an important project and it's got huge potential, both good and bad. Google made news last week when they announced they'd begun scanning physical books. This is a pretty big deal for them. It could generate huge amounts of data, and they could sell this data to various places (like, maybe, Apple), and the revenue would help them to drive costs down for their users. But it might also turn out to be a huge boon for people wanting to make a buck off of their books. It could also, theoretically, provide readers with a better means to search for books that they can read on their computers, phones, and ipods. So, let's break this down into three camps:The IPod/Apple: They're going to release an iPod that lets you view (and possibly download) ebooks, but the iTunes Store will probably only carry ebooks that Apple wants you to have, since they don't want to deal with Amazon and its DRM (and Amazon, being that big, can just walk away from the whole ebook thing, really). They can make a deal with a huge company, but they'd have to do it on Apple's terms, or they could make a deal with a bunch of indie ebooks, which they can't control, and the numbers would be pretty small compared to the volume of sales.The Kindle: They already control the marketplace for ebooks on this platform, and have sold millions of Kindles already. I don't think this really affects them in any way, other than to make sure they're in control of the platform so they can dominate the ebook market.The New York Times and the other mainstream media outlets: They are really excited about the prospect of Google scanning millions of books. They can get some for free, and they can also scan some of the books they already have and make them available. But if they want to sell any, they'll have to get permissions, so it could be a while before that happens.So, this is the question: if Google is going to start selling books, how will they do it? Google, being Google, is likely to do something completely different, so they have the opportunity to make some great stuff happen, but it'll take some time, and they may not have a lot of patience.

All patients showed large improvements in neuropsychological functioning after administration of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. They benefited from the drug, but with widely different underlying pathologies. This shows the need for using individualized treatment strategies. The possible role of genetic factors, mechanisms of action of levetiracetam, and possible side effects are discussed.\n\nNeuropsychological deficits are common in various psychiatric disorders and epilepsy. They often improve with treatment, but little is known about the efficacy and safety of the various treatment modalities.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA number of psychiatric disorders are characterized by neuropsychological deficits. Neuropsychological deficits may be seen in schizophrenia [1], mood disorders [2], obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [3], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [4], substance abuse [5], and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [6]. These neuropsychological deficits may arise from different pathophysiological mechanisms, and they are often described in terms of aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or impairment of cognitive processing.\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology of these neuropsychological deficits is complex. Deficits can be the result of many different disorders, including disease of the brain, neurodevelopmental disorders, disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS), or disorders that affect the body and are reflected in the CNS [7]. This is illustrated by the number of disorders in which neuropsychological deficits have been described (Table 1). In most patients, the neuropsychological deficits are caused by a combination of multiple different pathophysiological factors [7, 8].\n\nNeuropsychological deficits can occur with a variety of psychiatric disorders. When such deficits occur in epilepsy, there are specific cognitive deficits that are characteristic of the disorder [9]. When epilepsy occurs in combination with a psychiatric disorder, the cognitive deficits may be aggravated [9, 10]. When the psychiatric disorder itself involves cognitive deficits, they will also be aggravated. This will make the treatment of the underlying disorder more difficult. This will increase the risk of relapse, and may also increase the risk of cognitive deterioration.\n\nThe major types of treatments that are used for the various psychiatric disorders are listed in Table 2. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are one of the main forms of treatment for epilepsy. In the treatment of psychiatric disorders, especially when the psychiatric disorder is accompanied by neuropsychological deficits, AEDs are also frequently used. For these disorders, AEDs are often combined with psychotropic drugs. This leads to the question of whether AEDs may have a beneficial effect on neuropsychological functioning. Such an effect may improve the overall functioning of the patient.\n\nLevetiracetam is an AED that is registered in more than 50 countries and is licensed in the Netherlands as a monotherapy for the treatment of various types of epilepsy. It has been used in the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders. A recent review [11] found positive effects of levetiracetam on neuropsychological functioning in psychiatric patients with bipolar disorder and in a subgroup of depressed patients.\n\nBecause of the poor efficacy of the currently used treatment modalities, the search for new treatment strategies is ongoing. In particular, studies that investigate the possible therapeutic effects of AEDs are useful. In the treatment of epilepsy, there are various AEDs that may have specific effects on neuropsychological functioning [12]. The clinical effects of AEDs may depend on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that are present in a particular patient [8]. It is therefore possible that different types of AEDs have different effects on neuropsychological functioning. This may lead to a personalized treatment strategy for different patients. However, no such studies have been conducted.\n\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate the possible effects of levetiracetam on neuropsychological functioning in patients with different psychiatric disorders. The study focused on three major issues. First, it aimed to determine whether levetiracetam may have beneficial effects on neuropsychological functioning. Second, the efficacy of levetiracetam in different patient groups was compared. Third, the safety of levetiracetam was assessed.\n\nMETHODS\n\nSubjects\n\nThe study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands. All the patients were diagnosed at this center, and they all received treatment for their disorder(s). The following patient groups were included:\n\n1. Adults with bipolar disorder (n = 8)\n\n2. Adults with major depressive disorder (n = 6)\n\n3. Adults with OCD (n = 2)\n\n4. Adults with ADHD (n = 2)\n\n5. Adults with PTSD (n = 2)\n\n6. Adults with a variety of combinations of these disorders (n = 3)\n\nTable 1: Types of neuropsychological deficits in various psychiatric disorders.\n\nTable 2: Types of treatment for various psychiatric disorders.\n\nAll the patients were referred to the outpatient clinic because of their neuropsychological deficits. The patients were not selected on the basis of any specific criteria. All patients with a DSM-IV [13] diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, OCD, ADHD, or PTSD were included. Patients with bipolar disorder I and II, major depressive disorder I and II, and ADHD were also included if they were under the age of 18 years. Patients with PTSD and patients with other combinations of psychiatric disorders were included. All patients were between the ages of 18 and 65 years and were either male or female.\n\nAll patients were included in a longitudinal study [14]. During the course of the study, some patients were added and others dropped out of the study. Therefore, the number of patients included in the study changed over time. All patients gave their informed consent for their data to be used in the study. All patients received treatment with levetiracetam for at least 2 months. The following patients received levetiracetam for more than 2 months: five patients with bipolar disorder, three patients with major depressive disorder, and two patients with OCD. Patients were included in the study if they received levetiracetam at an average dose of less than 3,000 mg/day. One patient with PTSD received levetiracetam at an average dose of 5,500 mg/day.\n\nPatient data\n\nThe data on the patients were obtained from the clinical files of the University Medical Center Groningen and the files of the pharmacies where the patients received their levetiracetam.

Hindi literature in the classical form found its roots in the Bhakti movements of north India in the 16th century. Urdu literature has been cultivated with both influences and native traditions.\n\nThe colonial rule of the British Empire introduced English and western literature to India, and had the most profound impact on Hindi literature. In addition to the literature that evolved during the Mughal period, this period was also marked by the literary works of Bhakti saints.\n\nLike Persian, in Urdu also poetry played a central role. It was also the main language of the court, where Urdu was distinguished from Hindi by a heavy Persian vocabulary. The two developed a rich literary tradition with a profusion of prose genres and poetic forms. There are early Prakrit work of Dandin and Gunabhadra, an example for that Dandin was a Buddhist author and had done translation of sutras and sastras.\n\nIn South Asia, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Hindu nationalism in Hindi-speaking regions was expressed through the development of Hindi-language literature. During the 19th century, the Hindi literature developed the tradition of Dalit literature; works of B. In the 20th century, this tradition was carried forward by the Bhakti movement poets, in such notable works as Kabir and Amrita Pritam, the Western equivalent of which would be Whitman and Ginsberg.\n\nHindi literature is a formally recognized strand in the &quot;national literature&quot; of India. While India has several regional languages and traditions of literature, the &quot;national literature&quot; of India is written in Hindi.\n\nWhile Hindi is the official language of India, most literary works are written in regional languages. The prose works of the Bhakti Movement were originally written in various dialects of Hindi. The Awadhi dialect of Hindi has been influential in the development of Hindi prose, and most Hindi novels and short stories have been written in it.\n\nWith the translation of a large number of Western literary works in Hindi, there was a fresh impetus to the development of modern Hindi literature. This movement is called the Chhayavaad. One of the most prolific Hindi novelists was Premchand. Another great Hindi novelist was Munshi Premchand. An interest in Munshi Premchand's works among the wider populace has led to a resurgence in the popularity of his works. Other writers of the same era included Mahadevi Varma, Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Brijmohan Mishra, and Krishan Chander. The change in the Indian educational system, the literary taste of the people and the Hindi belt's growing cultural influence helped Hindi gain greater literary and socio-political popularity. Many Hindi writers belonging to this era are regarded as important figures in modern Indian literature.\n\nThe Anand family of novels is a sequence of novels by Munshi Premchand. The fictional village of Bawara in them is based on author's native town of Hamirpur.\n\nJai Arjun Singh (born in 1967) is an Indian Hindi fiction writer. He was a part of a modern generation of writers who were popular in the 1990s, along with Sachin Kundalkar, Krishna Sobti, etc. Singh has contributed short stories, novellas and novels in Hindi. He has received various awards, including the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Award for his work, both as a writer and editor. Singh's popularity as a Hindi writer was influenced by his early life in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAfter independence of India, the Hindi language has continued to grow in all Indian social sectors. Many Hindi writers and poets continued to write in the era of Independence.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru University is a prominent university in India, situated in New Delhi. JNU has produced a large number of important Hindi writers, including, among others, Vikram Seth, Mukul Kesavan, Gulzar, Harishankar Parsai, Anita Desai, Saadat Hasan Manto, Munshi Premchand, Acharya Chatursen, Dr. Pankaj Narayan, Bhisham Sahni, Amrita Pritam, Sumitranandan Pant, Satyajit Ray, Rajendra Yadav, Kedarnath Singh, Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar', Umashankar Joshi, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Vishnu Prabhakar, Ramesh Pangariya, Rajendra Keshavlal Dhandhale, Gopi Chand Narang, Vinay Bhargava, Brij Narayan, Chandrashekhar, Chaman Lal, Vimala Thakur and Prakash Swatantra Raju.]" time="0.412"><properties><property name="score" value="0.037926365" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.03792636&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.03792636

As CEO Elon Musk revealed, the company is planning to send its first operational satellites into space within the next couple of months.\n\nSpaceX already has two test satellites in orbit. The first is known as TinTin A and the second is TinTin B. The company has already tested the technology on these two devices, and will launch the first batch of satellites in a couple of months, and these will be in operation by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to The Verge, SpaceX has the go-ahead from the Federal Communications Commission to launch 4,425 satellites in low-Earth orbit. Musk explained that it would take seven launches of its Falcon 9 rocket to deploy all the satellites, and each launch would put up about 250 of them. Each satellite would weigh 250 pounds (110 kg), and SpaceX would use its Falcon 9 rocket for the launch.\n\nThe FCC has reportedly given SpaceX permission to launch more than 7,000 satellites in total, but the company will likely stop at 4,425 once the operational satellites are deployed.\n\nThe FCC already has approved another batch of satellites for SpaceX to launch. However, these will be in higher orbits, and the company will need special approvals from the International Telecommunications Union.\n\nSpaceX has already made arrangements with broadband Internet service providers to use its satellites once they are in orbit.\n\nThe company has said that its service will be \u201cfaster and cheaper\u201d than other broadband options. Its service will be aimed at the U.S. at first, but it may eventually expand to other countries.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s aim to bring high-speed broadband to more parts of the world will certainly be interesting to watch, but this may not be the only satellite-related announcement the company makes soon.\n\nAccording to reports, SpaceX is also planning to launch its Dragon 2 spacecraft to the International Space Station. This could happen as early as April 2019.\n\nThe Falcon 9\u2019s launch will put a high-resolution imaging satellite, known as PAZ, into orbit. The spacecraft was built by the European aerospace and defense contractor, Airbus.\n\nThe company said that the launch will use the same rocket that will be used for the Falcon 9 carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft to the ISS next month.\n\nWith the Falcon 9\u2019s payload fairing, the spacecraft will be about 11 feet (3.3 meters) in diameter.]" time="0.294"><properties><property name="score" value="0.009232772" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00923277&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00923277

That's especially since the actual soundtrack listing, which featured most of the score by composer Hans Zimmer, didn't include a sample of the song at all.\n\nWell, now fans can finally listen to a sample of that cover and get a better idea of what the soundtrack may offer. The cover song was recorded by Gary Clark Jr., and while it's pretty good, it's definitely missing something.\n\nAfter that fateful sequence in the movie, you'd think the song would feel more emotionally impactful, but instead it just feels hollow and shallow. It's not terrible, but the soundtrack version of the song isn't quite as strong as the cover version of the song.\n\nThe thing is, the song is actually pretty good, and it's fitting for the movie and doesn't feel out of place. However, because it doesn't fit the tone of the movie or soundtrack, it just doesn't sound like it belongs.\n\nIt's not like other DC films and scores, and doesn't mesh well with what fans have come to expect from DC's superhero movies. Granted, the movie isn't exactly like other DC films, and there's no way to predict what people would come to expect.\n\nThe movie is full of fun and action, so it's only fitting that the score reflects that and that it has a big, loud, rock 'n' roll sound. If it had an emotional and subdued soundtrack, it wouldn't be a good fit for the movie or the characters.\n\nWhile Zimmer may have done an excellent job with the music in the movie, it's not necessarily the best soundtrack or music that fits the film. Not that it was his fault or that it was his decision, but the movie's soundtrack is definitely lacking.\n\nThis is because they were trying to keep the movie as secretive as possible, and didn't want anyone to know what the ending was going to be.\n\nIn all honesty, it's not necessarily a bad idea, and most people don't care about the soundtrack anyway. It was the choice of song that people took issue with, and for good reason.\n\nThat said, it doesn't change the fact that the song is pretty good, and it's actually one of the better songs on the soundtrack, which doesn't say much for it.\n\nFor those who haven't seen the movie, the song is one of the more emotional songs on the soundtrack. It's also the first one that plays, and it's used to set the tone of the movie, which is definitely a major part of the movie.\n\nIn the beginning of the movie, when Bruce Wayne is discussing Superman with Alfred, he says, &quot;They\u2019ll fight. They\u2019ll kill. And when it\u2019s over, the world will be broken. We have to stop them.&quot;\n\nAnd then the song kicks in with a pretty sad tune, almost as if Bruce is predicting the future. It's an emotional and heavy song that sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and it fits the mood perfectly.\n\nIn the beginning, Clark Jr. is just talking about fighting, and while it sounds fine, it lacks the raw emotion and angst that the song needed to convey.\n\nWhen Clark sings, &quot;They\u2019ll fight. They\u2019ll kill. And when it\u2019s over, the world will be broken,&quot; the lyrics don't sound like they have any emotion or that the artist is really singing them. They just sound like he's repeating what's in the song without any real feeling behind it.\n\nIn the soundtrack version, Clark sounds like he's trying to convey emotion and feeling, and he sounds like he's actually singing the song instead of just reciting it.\n\nWhile the soundtrack version is much more emotional and powerful, the soundtrack version is just not as well done as the cover version. It's still one of the better songs on the soundtrack, but the difference in emotion and quality is quite noticeable.\n\nHopefully, the cover version isn't the final version of the song, and there will be an official version of the soundtrack that includes more of the score, and hopefully that version of the song.\n\nEither way, the movie is still amazing, and fans will just have to deal with what they get when the soundtrack is released.\n\nBatman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is now playing in theaters.]" time="0.339"><properties><property name="score" value="0.163470715" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[There are probably a lot of family members in your life that are into DIY projects.

In Arizona, for example, the monthly premium for a 27-year-old purchasing a silver plan would go from $208 a month under the Affordable Care Act to $277.41 under the Senate's version of Trumpcare.\n\nAccording to CAP, the &quot;modest&quot; subsidies included in the bill \u2014 ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 \u2014 would do little to protect Americans from soaring premiums. They note that the $2,000 subsidy would cover just a quarter of the premium cost for the average individual with an annual income of $28,000, leaving the individual on the hook for $6,500.\n\n&quot;Subsidies in the Senate bill are woefully inadequate for low- and middle-income Americans, and actually leave many people with higher costs and worse coverage,&quot; said Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at CAP, and a former top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama.\n\nTrumpcare is intended to lower premiums for younger, healthier Americans by slashing Medicaid, eliminating subsidies for insurance purchased on the individual market, and allowing insurers to charge older customers more for coverage.\n\nBut while premiums for young people may decrease, they are likely to go up substantially for older people, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office released on Monday.\n\n&quot;Older people are going to have to pay a heck of a lot more,&quot; an anonymous insurance industry source told Axios. &quot;I don't think the math works.&quot;]" time="0.316"><properties><property name="score" value="0.013419051" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01341905&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01341905

The church in Africa, in particular, is proving an attractive mission field for some Anglicans from Britain and the US.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the conference gave important support to our already announced policy of sanctioning certain developments in same-sex relationships. While still condemning homosexual practice as sinful, we showed compassion for those whose orientation towards same-sex relationships is unchangeable.\n\n\u201cWe were determined that, where there are those in the church who wish to bless such relationships, they should be able to do so.\n\n\u201cThe Anglican Church is a church of variety, but it is a powerful testimony to God\u2019s working.

In 1999 the bishop was appointed as the convenor of the Lambeth Conference by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nBishop Chartres has been the Anglican Bishop of London since 1997. Prior to that he was the Bishop of Stepney and then the Bishop of Monmouth. He was ordained in 1973 and served his first curacy at St Andrew\u2019s Notting Hill.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982 he was the curate of St Saviour\u2019s West Kensington and from 1982 to 1987, the vicar of St Michael\u2019s Margate. From 1987 to 1993 he was the diocesan missioner for Stepney, and from 1993 to 1997 he was the dean of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\n\nBishop Chartres also writes a weekly column for the Church Times, and he is a trustee of the National Council for Social Service.

She and Xander were sitting in his car. She'd just come back from the doctor. She thought that she was finally remembering how to act like a normal human being. She thought that she was finally remembering how to feel like a normal human being.\n\nXander touched her shoulder. &quot;What did the doctor say?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing.&quot; Buffy shrugged. &quot;They didn't do a thing. They were just doing a routine check-up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Checking up on you, huh?&quot;\n\nBuffy frowned. &quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, come on, Xander.

She hated when he put it that way. But Xander was right. They didn't want her here. She knew they didn't want her here. Why else would they do this? Why else would they make her go through the routine that every other person with brain damage goes through?\n\nBuffy reached over and turned on the radio. She turned it up, blocking out Xander's annoying voice.\n\nThey didn't want her here. They didn't care about her. It was all just a game.\n\nXander sighed. He was glad Buffy was back. He was so glad she was back. But he still couldn't help feeling bad for her. He couldn't help but worry about what would happen to her when this was all over. He couldn't help but wonder if he would be able to stop himself from hurting her when this was all over.\n\nHe drove around aimlessly. &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;\n\n&quot;About what?&quot; Buffy asked absently.\n\n&quot;About what's bothering you.&quot;\n\nBuffy sighed. &quot;Why does something have to be bothering me?&quot;\n\nXander smiled. &quot;You're Buffy. I know you better than you know yourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh.&quot; Buffy thought about that for a moment. It was true, she supposed. She was Buffy, and Xander was right. She couldn't remember everything about her old life, but she remembered Xander. She remembered him more than anyone else. &quot;So what is it? I mean, you're not usually this\u2026chummy with me.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was worried about you.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, I mean\u2026&quot; Buffy shook her head. &quot;You know what I mean.

You're in no condition to go anywhere.&quot;\n\n&quot;What makes you think that? I'm not in a wheelchair, I'm not using a cane. I'm just a little slow.&quot;\n\n&quot;That's the thing, Buffy. You're not slow.

The whole time.&quot;\n\n&quot;You didn't, Buffy. You couldn't.

The platform is called \u201cSAFE-WEB\u201d and is presented in the paper. SAFE-WEB allows an easy registration of sensors and drones. Furthermore, it gives the possibility to integrate and visualize the obtained data. Furthermore, several types of risk analysis are possible in SAFE-WEB. A unique feature is the capability to specify an area, where drones and/or sensors can fly, and to create a risk analysis only for the desired area. This makes it possible to perform an efficient analysis and evaluation of the obtained data. Finally, an example of the application of the risk analysis will be presented. The application is carried out using a 3D model of a Nuclear Facility.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nNuclear power stations represent very large facilities. In general, the normal plant operation comprises many smaller building units. The normal surveillance is, therefore, divided into different parts of the plant and has the advantage that it is not necessary to inspect the whole plant in one time.\n\nIn the paper the 3D model of a nuclear power plant is analyzed and assessed using the available drone and sensor data. The analysis of the model is necessary because the object is used to specify the area for the flight of the drones and to set the risk analysis region.\n\n1.1. Area for Drones\n\nThe advantage of drones for inspections is that they can fly directly in the area, which is of interest. This is not possible using normal manned aircraft. The limitation of drones is that they have to be within the control of the operator. They have to be able to see them in order to be able to control them. The control is needed to avoid collision with other drones or collisions with the buildings of the object. In this paper, two options for the control of the drones are presented. The first is an autonomous flight control and the second is the control via an operator.\n\nFigure 1.1. shows the \u201carea for drones\u201d for the 3D model of the nuclear facility. This area is created by the operator who specifies the region, where drones should be allowed to fly and where the analysis should be performed. For example, the operator can select the area shown in Figure 1.1. and then the drones and sensors are used to perform the analysis and evaluation only in this area.\n\nFigure 1.1. Area for the drones.\n\n1.2. Risk Analysis Region\n\nThe drones and sensors need a clearly specified area to carry out the analysis. The area is called \u201crisk analysis region\u201d. For example, if the operator selects the area shown in Figure 1.1. for the analysis, the drones and sensors fly in this area. Then, the data are gathered and analyzed by the operator. Then, the result is presented to the operator.\n\nIn this paper, two different options for the risk analysis are presented. The first one is an automatic risk analysis, where the user specifies a maximum amount of permissible risk. The second option is the capability to specify a risk analysis region with a boundary, where the area is cut off, where drones and sensors are not allowed to fly. In this paper, the automatic risk analysis is presented.\n\nThe capability to automatically generate the risk analysis region is a great advantage. The operator does not need to know the exact area of interest. He just specifies a general area. The automatic risk analysis can be performed in several levels. The highest level includes several basic items like structural failure, fire, blast and irradiation. This level of analysis is also called \u201csuper-level\u201d.\n\nThe super-level is a very large amount of data. The number of variables is about 25 times the number of variables for the normal risk analysis. Because of this, the super-level is used only if there is a specific need for it.\n\nThe analysis is very useful and important to perform inspections, which will be controlled by drones and sensors. In this paper, the analysis is applied to the nuclear facility shown in Figure 1.2. This nuclear power plant consists of five units. Three of these units are different types of nuclear reactors. The main part of the nuclear power plant is the \u201ccontainment building\u201d which is not shown in Figure 1.2. The small boxes in Figure 1.2 are the different units, which are part of the nuclear facility.\n\nFigure 1.2. Nuclear power plant\n\nIn order to create the analysis, several sensors are used. Figure 1.3 shows the sensors, which are necessary for the analysis of the nuclear facility shown in Figure 1.2. There are four drones which are used to create the top view. Furthermore, there are two sensors which are needed to gather the data for the analysis. One sensor is a small helicopter and the second one is a car. The sensors are used to gather data like radiation, temperatures and stress on the walls of the building.\n\nFigure 1.3. Sensors for the analysis\n\n2. Preparation of the Model for the Analysis\n\nIn this section, the preparation of the model for the analysis is shown.\n\nThe main part of the preparation of the model is to create a map which shows the 3D area. Figure 1.4 shows the map of the model. The big rectangle shows the total area of the nuclear facility. Inside the rectangle, the specific area of interest is shown. The analysis will only be performed inside the area shown in Figure 1.4. The selected area is large enough to allow a safe flight of the drones. The selected area is used to generate the analysis region and it is also used to specify the area for the drones and sensors.\n\nFigure 1.4. Map of the model\n\nIn addition to the area for the drones and sensors, the following must be defined:\n\nThe locations of the drones\n\nThe locations of the sensors\n\nA description of the analysis, which is carried out on the drones and sensors\n\nFurthermore, the model needs to be prepared for the required analysis. To do this, the sensor data and the drone data are to be analyzed.\n\n2.1. Sensor Data\n\nThe sensor data are measured by the sensors in the area, where the analysis is to be performed. The data are gathered by the sensors and then sent to the operator. The operator can analyze the data and then specify the risk analysis area and the risk analysis itself.\n\nThe sensors are used for the following measurements:\n\nRadiation\n\nTemperature\n\nStress on the walls\n\nOne of the important measurements is radiation. The following data are required for the analysis of the radiation:\n\nPeak value\n\nAverage value\n\nArea\n\nFor each measurement, one or more locations are defined. The data are then gathered and a map, which shows the measurement result, is created. Figure 1.5 shows an example of the map. The map shows the radiation measured in one of the locations. In addition, the peak value, average value and the area of the radiation is shown in the map.\n\nFigure 1.5. Example of the map, which shows the measurement results\n\nThe data are shown in a map which has a high resolution. Figure 1.5. shows a map with a resolution of 1m x 1m.\n\n2.2. Drone Data\n\nThe drone data is the result of the data gathered by the drones in the area, where the analysis is to be performed. The data are gathered and the drone control software interprets the data. The results of the data are sent to the operator and they are used to determine the analysis region.\n\nThe data, which are used for the analysis of the drones are:\n\nRadiation\n\nTemperature\n\nStress on the walls\n\nOne of the important data is radiation. The following data are required for the analysis of the radiation:\n\nPeak value\n\nAverage value\n\nArea\n\nFor each measurement, one or more locations are defined. The data are then gathered and a map, which shows the measurement result, is created. Figure 1.6 shows an example of the map. The map shows the radiation measured in one of the locations. In addition, the peak value, average value and the area of the radiation is shown in the map.\n\nFigure 1.6. Example of the map, which shows the measurement results\n\nThe data are shown in a map which has a high resolution. Figure 1.6. shows a map with a resolution of 1m x 1m.\n\n2.3. Analysis of the Drone Data\n\nThe drone data is used to create the analysis region. This is done by specifying the area in which the drone can fly and by creating the risk analysis.\n\nTo do this, the operator creates a map, which shows the drone flight area. Figure 1.7. shows the drone flight area for the 3D model of the nuclear power plant. The flight area has a large size because the drones are controlled by an operator. This means that the drones have to be in the range of the operator\u2019s sight. For this reason, the area has to be big.\n\nFigure 1.7. Drone flight area\n\nThe drone flight area is then used to create the risk analysis. Figure 1.8. shows the risk analysis for the drone flight area. The drone flight area is shown in blue. The analysis is created for the area where the operator can see the drones.\n\nFigure 1.8. Drone flight area and risk analysis\n\nThe operator has several options to create the risk analysis. In this paper, the operator can define a maximum level of permissible risk for the radiation. This means that the risk analysis is carried out automatically.

Two data sources we present here are as follows.\n\nWe have shown the strong association between cardiovascular and other diseases and calcium dysregulation in the United States in both men and women by estimating the prevalence of hypertension and calcium dysregulation based on a large and well-defined population of middle-aged adults. Our finding that the prevalence of calcium dysregulation, i.e., a positive response to one or more questions, was 4.1% in men and 4.3% in women was comparable to a number of other previous studies. We reported for the first time that age, race, and disease all modified the association between hypertension and calcium dysregulation.\n\nAnother novel finding in this study was that calcium dysregulation was not associated with increased mortality in middle-aged men but was associated with increased mortality in middle-aged women. The former finding suggests that the adverse health effects of hypertension and calcium dysregulation are equivalent in men and women and therefore the differences in the prevalence of these factors by sex should be considered when evaluating the associations of hypertension and calcium dysregulation with disease. The latter finding, i.e., increased mortality in women with calcium dysregulation, has been shown in prior studies [3, 4, 15, 29, 30].\n\nThe observed associations of calcium dysregulation with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease are the same in men and women, and the associations with stroke, coronary artery disease, and kidney disease are equivalent. This suggests that the mechanisms by which these associations occur in men and women are similar. This would be expected because the calcium levels in blood are, to a large extent, regulated in a similar way in both men and women, i.e., by calcium binding proteins [20]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the associations are different in men and women because they may be due to different distributions of risk factors in men and women or because they may reflect different amounts of disease in the two sexes. For example, the correlation between calcium dysregulation and hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease may be different in men and women because the disease prevalence is different. Also, the amount of calcium dysregulation may be different in men and women, for example, because of differences in serum calcium levels. It would be important to further study the relationship between calcium dysregulation and various diseases in men and women to confirm our finding.\n\nThe association between calcium dysregulation and mortality was stronger in men with hypertension than in men without hypertension, although the associations were similar in men with and without hypertension in women. The reason for this is unknown. However, these findings are consistent with previous findings that the association between hypertension and mortality is stronger in men than in women [31, 32, 33]. We also found that calcium dysregulation was associated with increased mortality in middle-aged women but not in middle-aged men. This is consistent with the findings of a previous report that the association between calcium dysregulation and mortality is stronger in middle-aged women than in middle-aged men [34]. This could be due to the fact that a stronger association between calcium dysregulation and mortality in middle-aged women is due to a stronger association between calcium dysregulation and hypertension in middle-aged women than in men. Also, the stronger association between calcium dysregulation and mortality in middle-aged women than in middle-aged men could be due to a stronger association between calcium dysregulation and mortality in women who are at an advanced age, especially when hypertension has already developed.\n\nBecause calcium dysregulation was associated with increased mortality in women, we evaluated the possibility that the association between calcium dysregulation and mortality was due to undiagnosed hypertension or hyperglycemia.

It's &quot;firmware&quot; not &quot;firm ware.&quot; Try to get a better handle on your grammar before you get your grammar wrong.\n\n2. Calling something a &quot;feature&quot; doesn't make it a feature. It's a mislabeling. The way these displays are lit up is a hardware implementation of a &quot;gradient.&quot; The gradient of color is the &quot;feature&quot; of the gradient, not the entire display.\n\n3. The function of a gradient in this case is not to &quot;determine&quot; color or value, it is to make the display more aesthetically pleasing. There is a huge difference.\n\n4. The system was designed by people who knew how to do lighting in a way that adds visual interest. There is a reason that their work was considered &quot;taste-based.&quot; It was designed by people who knew how to do lighting. Lighting is all about creating mood and impact, not function.\n\n5. The system was designed so that it would be physically impossible to light all the light sources the same, that way there would be no color &quot;accurate&quot; (read &quot;unpleasing&quot;) way to light the display. As long as people can see it clearly, it will never be &quot;accurate.&quot;\n\n6. In this application, color accuracy is the least of the concerns, and it is not the main consideration. It is a display, not a video image.\n\n7. If the numbers of the OLEDs are off, they will still light up. They will not &quot;burn in.&quot; A long exposure to a dark scene will turn the display black, and that's all there is to it.\n\n8. Those are just panels with color filters over them. They are not LEDs. The whites are not being filtered, they are being lit up as one.\n\n9. Because they are lit up individually and not together as a whole, the panels do not &quot;add up&quot; to make the perceived color and intensity of light. It's a bit like red, green and blue, and how they do not really &quot;add up&quot; to make a full white light. (And the full white you see is more likely white than red, green or blue).\n\n10. Just because you can prove that something is &quot;not black&quot; doesn't make it &quot;not black.&quot; There are more than a few tungsten lamps out there that aren't really &quot;black,&quot; but people would be pretty annoyed if you said they weren't really &quot;black.&quot;\n\n11. White LEDs are also not the most &quot;color accurate&quot; light source out there. They have to be filtered to get that way. If you don't filter them, you don't get the same white as if you did filter them.\n\n12. People actually are aware of color. It is not as if they cannot distinguish color differences. They may not see every single pixel of difference, but they are still going to see differences. They can distinguish a difference between an &quot;R&quot; and an &quot;L&quot; in some fonts. If you put those two letters side by side, the difference will be visible. It is not going to look identical to them.\n\n13. &quot;Accurate color&quot; is a subjective term. What may be accurate to you may not be accurate to me.\n\n14. Just because a company makes an extra $10 by selling you a part that does something that it was not designed for doesn't make it right. It just means you are getting ripped off.\n\n15. Yes, the color of the display is very important to the perception of the light in the environment, but it is not the only factor.\n\n16. Not all blue LEDs are the same. In fact, the blue from blue LEDs changes with age. You have to take this into account in your designs.\n\n17. No, it is not impossible to change the light of a display.\n\n18. Yes, you can still get better uniformity if you combine the LEDs into one panel. You will also get better efficiency, but the screen won't look as good.\n\n19. The individual LEDs can only emit a certain amount of light. They cannot magically produce more.\n\n20. You can get even better efficiency if you replace the red and green LEDs with white LEDs. It is a tradeoff, though. It is not a free lunch.\n\n21. LEDs emit light in a different range of color than the human eye can detect. They have a certain distribution of color, not a specific one.\n\n22. Because the color distribution of the LEDs is not the same as the human eye, you have to modify the LEDs to make them appear to the human eye as if they were emitting the correct color light.\n\n23. The human eye is not linear, which is what is being assumed. This is what allows you to see the color of white. It is also what allows you to perceive the color of a cloudy sky.\n\n24. If you want to look at &quot;color accuracy,&quot; take a look at the color of the light in the environment that the display is in. It will be different in each of them. The difference between the human eye and a camera is also a huge consideration, as cameras are not very good at capturing all of the available color in an image.\n\n25. Blue LEDs do not go through a filter to be blue. They are actually more &quot;white&quot; than blue, so you have to color-filter them. This is not necessarily an &quot;extra&quot; step, as it does not have to be done to &quot;make them blue.&quot;\n\n26. You can make a good case for certain LEDs being &quot;super blue,&quot; but you cannot make a case that they are &quot;super red.&quot; Red is the hardest color for LEDs to produce. You can make the case that you can produce more &quot;pure&quot; red than can be seen by the human eye, but you cannot make the case that you can produce more &quot;pure&quot; red than can be produced by a red LED.\n\n27. If the LEDs can do something &quot;super&quot; (in this case, &quot;super red&quot;), then the LEDs can do something &quot;normal&quot; (in this case, &quot;normal red.&quot;) There is no free lunch, there are just tradeoffs.\n\n28. Trying to compare &quot;new&quot; with &quot;old&quot; (to sell you something) is an old, well-established, tired sales technique.\n\n29. You can say a person has 20/20 vision, but you cannot say a display has &quot;perfect color.&quot;\n\n30. Yes, OLEDs can do things that no other display technology can do. They can also do things that some other display technologies can do. That does not mean that you can't make a display that has features that OLEDs don't have.\n\n31. You can make a display that has good color rendition, that is not an OLED. It just means you are not using OLEDs.\n\n32. Just because a manufacturer says &quot;this is what you are going to get&quot; doesn't mean you are going to get it. If you need something that is color accurate, you need to specify it. If you do not, then you get what they give you.\n\n33. If you look at a display and you say &quot;it looks too blue,&quot; then you are probably right. But that doesn't mean it is inaccurate. That just means you are looking at it the way you would look at it in real life.\n\n34. There are many factors that influence color perception in a viewing environment. There is no single factor that influences color perception in a viewing environment.\n\n35. Color accuracy is just one aspect of the human visual system, and just because it is not the only aspect does not make it not the only aspect.\n\n36. If you are a designer, you have to understand the limits of the technology and the product that you are working with. If you do not, then you are not going to be very successful.\n\n37. People like to think that designers can control everything, but they can't. It's just a fact of life.\n\n38. The human visual system is much more complicated than a display or a camera.\n\n39. Just because a technology has a lot of colors, it doesn't mean you have to use all of them.\n\n40. Just because a display can produce a certain color, it doesn't mean you have to use it.\n\n41.

He was later elected as a U.S. Senator from California.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nCarleton was born in Claremont, New Hampshire, son of Francis Carleton (1821\u20131902) and Lydia (Patterson) Carleton (1819\u20131901). He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1873. After graduation, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st Cavalry Regiment.\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nIn the Apache Wars, Carleton commanded Apache scouts in the Army of the Southwest from 1880 to 1882. As an officer with the rank of captain in 1885, Carleton served with the 9th Cavalry in Texas. During the Spanish\u2013American War, he commanded a volunteer troop of the Rough Riders at the Battle of San Juan Hill. He then led troops in Cuba, and from 1899 to 1900 served as a military observer in South Africa. In 1900, Carleton was sent to the Philippines, where he served in a number of different positions, and became a close confidant of future Philippine president Manuel Quezon.[1]\n\nIn 1902, Carleton was appointed Adjutant General of the Philippines, and from 1903 to 1906 he served as governor of Mindanao. In 1907, he returned to the United States and worked as the adjutant general of the Army until his retirement in 1911. In retirement, Carleton was active in civic and business affairs in San Francisco. He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1914 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James D. Phelan and served from December 2, 1914, to March 3, 1917.\n\nDeath [ edit ]\n\nCarleton died in Berkeley, California, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nOn June 4, 1881, Carleton married Mary King White, the daughter of General Rufus King of New York.

The new building, which opened in August 2009, was constructed to provide specialized laboratory and classroom space for chemistry, biology, earth science, mathematics, physics, and digital art, graphics, and photography programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited and honored to receive this prestigious recognition,\u201d said Dr. C. Stanley (Bucky) Jones, president of Vanguard University. \u201cIn addition to the environmental benefits of this new facility, it is also extremely functional. It has set a high standard for us to follow in future construction and renovation projects.\u201d\n\nLEED Platinum is the highest of four levels of LEED certification. Buildings must achieve a score of at least 80 out of 100 possible points to receive the award. Hunt Hall\u2019s score is 93.\n\nTo achieve platinum status, Hunt Hall used recycled and low VOC materials, is more energy efficient, has better indoor air quality, and has extensive indoor and outdoor water conservation measures.\n\nHunt Hall is designed with innovative features to conserve water, including low-flow toilets, a ground-water recovery system for toilets and urinals, and low-flow showerheads. The building also has low-flow hand dryers and high-efficiency faucets. Outdoor water-wise features include drought-tolerant landscaping and a rooftop rainwater catchment system.\n\nOther water conservation features include a dark-colored roof, skylights, and window blinds that use computer-controlled solar shades that open and close automatically, saving additional energy when daylight is sufficient.\n\nTo help conserve energy, Hunt Hall uses photo-voltaic panels for electricity, and high-performance exterior windows and insulated walls that reduce the need for heating and cooling. The building has heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems that provide highly efficient temperature control.\n\nA green roof on top of the building protects the building from sun and rainfall, and reduces the amount of storm water that needs to be treated.\n\nA LEED point is awarded for each of seven categories: sustainable site, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation and design, and regional priority.\n\nHunt Hall has won several other awards since its completion. It was the recipient of the Grand Award for Best Green Building by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA), in the high school and higher education categories.

The authors determined whether a trial was registered or not. From the conclusions:\n\nAs of January 2013, 56% (68 of 116) of trials had results available in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Web site. For registered trials, there was a positive association between registered status and the likelihood of publication of trial results in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Although there was no statistically significant association between trial outcome and registration status, there was a trend toward more positive results being published for registered trials.\n\nThis study suggests that, while registered results don\u2019t guarantee publication, they have a positive impact. Yet it\u2019s important to remember that the proportion of trials registered that are actually published was about half (54%), which is far from 100%. I would also like to see this study replicated in other clinical trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov and the European Clinical Trial Register), since the JCO is a highly selective journal. I would also like to see a study with a longer time-frame. I don\u2019t know how long the paper was in the works, but I\u2019m guessing it took a while.\n\nWhile the study seems reasonable, I\u2019m not sure how much one can extrapolate from this paper in terms of impact on clinical trial registration and publication of results. It\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle, as AllTrials points out.\n\nImage by dave_7 via Flickr\n\nLike this: Like Loading...]" time="0.304"><properties><property name="score" value="0.009330049" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00933005&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00933005

In one of his most iconic roles, Top Gun, Cruise actually flew jets in real-life. For his new movie Jack Reacher, however, he had to leave his stunt man behind.\n\nWith director Christopher McQuarrie at the helm, Jack Reacher looks to be a hard-hitting action thriller that promises to give Cruise's daredevil side some free reign. One of the most dangerous scenes in the film? The moment Cruise's character runs into a car traveling at 50 mph.\n\nWith the help of stuntman Tim Rigby, Cruise made the risky move a reality. The actor explains that the car wasn't able to stop due to the speed at which it was traveling, so he had to make his run-in count.

got your SCOM environment setup, what do you do with it?\n\nThe next step is learning how to manage your environments using your new management system. There are a lot of options to learn, but you can get started with the basics fairly quickly and then move to advanced topics later. This blog is intended to introduce you to some of the basic tasks you can perform in SCOM once you have it up and running.\n\nFirst, you should know that there are three main nodes in the Operations Manager tree. The top node is the Management Group, the middle is the management server, and the bottom is the agent. We will focus on the top node and the bottom node.\n\nIn order to get started, the first thing you want to do is add one or more agent to your management group. I\u2019ll focus on adding agents to the management group. When you get to a point where you are adding lots of agents, you can set up a group for those agents and add them as a group.\n\nTo add an agent, first select the root node, and then right click the Management Servers node. Select \u201cAdd Management Server\u201d.\n\nThis will open the \u201cAdd Management Server\u201d dialog. Select the agent you want to add.\n\nNow select the agent you want to add. This dialog allows you to define the monitoring root and specifies the details for the agent.\n\nThe next step is to add the management group to the console. Once you\u2019ve added one or more management servers to the console, the next step is to add the management group. This is similar to adding the management servers, except you will be selecting the management group.\n\nThis will open the \u201cAdd Management Group\u201d dialog. Select the group you want to add.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve added the management group, you should be able to see the management servers and agent(s) within the management group. Now you\u2019ve got the basics setup.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll want to start monitoring something. Before you do anything, you should probably check out the default monitoring packs in Operations Manager. For SCOM 2007 there are two packs that are part of the default installation. They are Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) and Microsoft Monitoring Agent (32bit). These packs are installed under the default management group.\n\nMonitoring a node, service or application with these packs is very easy. Select the node you want to monitor, and then select the Pack.\n\nIn this example, I selected a server and then the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) pack. This will bring up the Select and Monitor Wizard.\n\nOn the \u201cSelect the monitored resource\u201d screen, select the computer you want to monitor. The wizard is pretty self explanatory. Click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nThe wizard will display a list of available services, applications, processes, and other entities that can be monitored.\n\nSelect the items you want to monitor. In this case, I will monitor the process \u201cexplorer.exe\u201d and the Service \u201cBITS\u201d. Click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nThe last step is to review the information on the \u201cSelect Resources to Monitor\u201d screen and then click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nThe wizard will display the information about the monitors you\u2019ve selected. Click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nYou will now be taken to the \u201cSelect Management Packs to monitor\u201d screen. Select the packs you want to use. In this case, I am going to select Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) and Microsoft System Center Service Manager.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected the appropriate management packs, click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nThe next step is to select the default displays. There are a number of displays you can use to view the information that is gathered from the agent. You can view the data for the computer, the agents, and you can also view the inventory. The inventory allows you to view the computer hardware and software information.\n\nSelect the displays you want to use, and then click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nThe wizard will display the information about the displays you\u2019ve selected. Click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nThe wizard will then list the monitors and displays that are associated with the management pack. Click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nThe last step is to review the information on the \u201cSelect Monitors and Display\u201d screen. Make sure the information is correct. If you\u2019ve chosen to monitor the system state, you\u2019ll also be asked to select the critical state you want to monitor. Once you\u2019ve verified the information, click \u201cFinish\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cMonitoring Wizard\u201d will start and monitor the information you\u2019ve selected. Click \u201cNext\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019ve selected the \u201cAgent inventory\u201d you\u2019ll be able to view the hardware and software information. This information is useful when you are performing assessments on your systems. You can use this information to validate your environment.\n\nYou can also view the monitors for the agent. Click \u201cView Monitor\u201d.\n\nYou can drill down into the monitors and view the details about the monitored information. Click \u201cView Data\u201d.\n\nYou can also view the monitored items graphically.\n\nThese packs allow you to quickly and easily get a view of the status of the monitored entities. In the next part of this series, I will talk about creating your own monitoring packs and will include examples.]" time="0.330"><properties><property name="score" value="0.0006084038" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[the intractable issue of euthanasia\n\nRecent Examples on the Web\n\nThis is a good moment to highlight the intractable problem of lagging political reform in Myanmar.

Josey Wales was started in 2008. They are currently signed with NiznoRecords.com. Josey Wales have released two EPs to date and one full length album. Their debut EP &quot;And So It Begins...&quot; was released in January 2009. Their follow up EP &quot;The Way It Wasn't&quot; was released in November of the same year. Their debut album &quot;Losing The War&quot; was released on October 12, 2010 and features the single &quot;Instrumentals&quot;, as well as the title track &quot;Losing The War&quot;, which is also the name of their first tour. The band's first music video was &quot;Instrumentals&quot; and it was released on May 13, 2010. Their second music video was for the single &quot;A Light Amongst All This Darkness&quot;, and was released on May 31, 2011.\n\nJosey Wales is a Christian band. They also have stated that they are a band for everyone. In an interview on the August 13th, 2010 episode of CincyMusic.com Live! Josey Wales said that they're trying to bring together two completely different types of fans in Christian and non-Christian. Their goal is to be a bridge for people that might be on opposite sides of the fence. Their main goal is to tell the world about Jesus Christ, and what it means to be a Christian. They are not afraid to be themselves, and they want people to see their passion for Christ.\n\nJosey Wales has recently done some regional tours, one with Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start (who's lead singer is Max Bemis of Say Anything) and they've done a tour with For All]" time="0.275"><properties><property name="score" value="0.07717216" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_openai_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Khevron\n\n(Tollerman)\n\nI think it's best not to be a part of this kind of mess and just let everyone do what they want with it.\n\nI really don't care how you decide, because I probably won't be playing with you again.\n\nYou say I made you quit... but you didn't have to quit the clan because of me.\n\nNo, I didn't care if you quit or not.

And after seeing how the event in Chicago went, we decided to go ahead with this week\u2019s events as planned.\n\nThe second event at NYU went very well. The student population at NYU is very different than the population at the University of Chicago. It is a lot smaller and it is not a natural fit for our events.\n\nWe want to serve the students and do so in a way that works for them and so after talking to the students in New York, we decided to move Food for Thought off of our weekly rotation for the fall. It is just not a good fit for them right now.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWe\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re moving Food for Thought forward and not backward. The goal here is not to try and find a place for Food for Thought that it will fit in, the goal is to find a place for Food for Thought that it will fit in.\n\nIf we have another event at the University of Chicago that\u2019s a success, we\u2019ll move forward and try to get one at another school.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be using the extra time we have this week to work on logistics and see if there is anything we need to change in the way we organize our events in the future.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for your organization?\n\nWe\u2019re still going to be fundraising and we\u2019re still going to be putting on events, but we\u2019re going to be using the extra time this week to come up with new ideas for future events.\n\nHow can students get involved with Food for Thought?\n\nStudents can volunteer at our events. We also have a contact on our website for students who are interested in volunteering. And we\u2019re looking for ideas and we\u2019re always interested in hearing from students.\n\nIs the Food for Thought logo going to change?\n\nIt\u2019s not going to change anytime soon, but we are looking into other things we can do to get more publicity for the Food for Thought project.\n\nWe\u2019re looking into new ways to do fundraising. We\u2019re looking at getting the word out there more, and it\u2019s all because of what the students have done at these events this week.\n\nIf students had one question to ask you, what would it be?\n\n\u201cWhy do you do what you do?\u201d I think it\u2019s because when I was in college, it was really hard to make friends, it was really hard to figure out where I fit in, and it was really hard to figure out where I was going to work. And so now I\u2019m trying to help students be successful.\n\nAnd even though I wasn\u2019t successful when I was in college, I\u2019m just trying to pay it forward.\n\nhttp://www.uchicago.edu/student-life/info/food-thought/]" time="0.326"><properties><property name="score" value="0.30786014" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.30786014&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.30786014
