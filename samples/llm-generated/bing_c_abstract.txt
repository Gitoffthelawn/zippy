The internet has been a major force of change in the English language, affecting its vocabulary, grammar, dialects and literacy. This paper examines some of the key ways that the internet has shaped and transformed English, drawing on examples from various online platforms and sources. The paper argues that the internet has not only added thousands of new words and expressions to English1, but also created new linguistic features and conventions that are specific to the online medium2. Moreover, the paper explores how the internet has enabled speakers of different varieties of English to interact and influence each other1, as well as how it has challenged the dominance and standardization of English in the global context345. The paper concludes that the internet has been a source of creativity and diversity in the English language, as well as a catalyst for linguistic innovation and evolution.
