We present the discovery and characterization of a potentially habitable exoplanet, TOI-715 b, orbiting a nearby M4 dwarf star located near the ecliptic South Pole. Using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and ground-based follow-up observations, we determined the planet's radius to be approximately 1.55 times that of Earth (R⊕) and its orbital period to be 17.9 days. Our analysis indicates that TOI-715 b resides within the conservative habitable zone of its host star, where liquid water could potentially exist on its surface.

By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectroscopy from the Magellan/PFS instrument, we obtained a precise estimate of the host star's properties. With an effective temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 0.34 R⊙, TOI-715 is an M4 dwarf star, characterized by low luminosity and a longer main-sequence lifetime compared to more massive stars. The star exhibits low levels of chromospheric activity, making it an ideal target for precise radial velocity measurements.

Utilizing these precise radial velocity measurements from the HARPS-N spectrograph, we derived the mass of TOI-715 b to be approximately 3.8 times that of Earth (M⊕). The combination of the planet's radius and mass suggests a rocky composition. Furthermore, we conducted detailed atmospheric characterization using the Hubble Space Telescope, revealing potential molecular absorption features consistent with the presence of an Earth-like atmosphere.

Through climate modeling simulations, we investigated the potential habitability of TOI-715 b. Our results suggest that the planet's atmosphere is likely to exhibit a substantial greenhouse effect, resulting in an increased surface temperature. However, given the estimated equilibrium temperature, TOI-715 b may still possess conditions suitable for the presence of liquid water, particularly in regions of lower albedo or with a thinner atmosphere.

The discovery of TOI-715 b underscores the importance of investigating exoplanets around M dwarf stars, which are abundant in our galaxy. With its proximity and favorable characteristics, TOI-715 b represents an intriguing target for future studies aiming to characterize the atmospheric composition, surface conditions, and potential habitability of exoplanets in the M dwarf regime.
