17,AI,BBC + GPT 3,0.27,1.00,1.00,1.00,"The recent announcement of the potential takeover of Domecq by Pernod has caused a stir in the drinks industry. Pernod, one of the world's largest spirits companies, is in talks to buy the drinks arm of Allied Domecq, the second largest spirits company, in a deal valued at Â£7.3 billion ($13.3 billion). 

The potential merger has been met with enthusiasm by both companies, who have long been rivals in the drinks market. Pernod has long been a dominant player in the market, with its portfolio of popular spirits including Absolut Vodka, Chivas Regal Scotch, and Malibu rum. Allied Domecq, on the other hand, is best known for its portfolio of wines, as well as its popular spirits, including Beefeater gin and Ballantine's whiskey.

The combination of Pernod and Allied Domecq would create a formidable force in the drinks market, with the merged company being the world's second-largest spirits maker. It would also give Pernod access to Allied Domecq's strong presence in the United States, where the latter has a particularly strong foothold.

The potential takeover has had a positive effect on Domecq's share price. Since news of the deal emerged, it has seen a 7% increase in its share price, with many investors speculating that the merger will be good for business.

The success of the takeover, however, is not guaranteed. The deal still has to be passed by shareholders and antitrust authorities, and any potential buyer would have to compete with other bidders, such as Diageo. 

Nevertheless, the potential takeover of Domecq by Pernod has caused a stir in the drinks industry and has been met with enthusiasm by investors. If successful, it could create a powerful new player in the drinks market, with both companies benefiting from the merger."
18,AI,BBC + GPT 4,0.97,1.00,1.00,1.00,"The Swedish company Electrolux announced yesterday that it plans to move production of washing machines from Sweden to Poland, in a move that will see around 2,000 jobs lost in Europe. The company said that the decision was made in order to ""remain competitive"", and that the jobs would be moved to a ""lower-cost country"".

This news will come as a huge blow to the workers who will lose their jobs, and to the Swedish economy more broadly. It is yet another example of how globalization and the race to the bottom in terms of labour costs is damaging European industry. While companies like Electrolux are able to move production to wherever is cheapest, workers are left behind, with little prospect of finding new employment.

It is time for the European Union to take action to protect its industries and workers from this damaging trend. We need to see a level playing field, where companies are not able to exploit workers in other countries in order to lower their own costs. Otherwise, we will continue to see jobs and businesses lost, to the detriment of us all."

22,AI,GPT-3,0.49,1.00,1.00,1.00,"Sure, here's a step-by-step guide for finding the area of a scalene triangle with two sides of 6 cm and 8 cm and an included angle of 45 degrees:
Step 1: Use the cosine rule to find the length of the third side of the triangle. The cosine rule states that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C), where c is the length of the third side, a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, and C is the included angle. In this case, a = 6 cm, b = 8 cm, and C = 45 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:
c^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 - 2(6)(8)cos(45)
c^2 = 36 + 64 - 96(0.7071)
c^2 = 100 - 67.68
c^2 = 32.32
c = 5.68 cm (rounded to two decimal places)
Step 2: Use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is given by:
Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where s is the semiperimeter (half the perimeter) of the triangle. In this case, the semiperimeter is:
s = (a + b + c)/2
s = (6 + 8 + 5.68)/2
s = 9.34 cm
Plugging this value and the lengths of the sides into the formula gives us:
Area = sqrt(9.34(9.34-6)(9.34-8)(9.34-5.68))
Area = sqrt(9.34(3.34)(1.34)(3.66))
Area = sqrt(44.93)
Area = 6.70 cm^2 (rounded to two decimal places)
Therefore, the area of the scalene triangle with two sides of 6 cm and 8 cm and an included angle of 45 degrees is 6.70 cm^2."

26,AI,GPT-3,0.65,1.00,1.00,1.00,"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific information about a person's coffee preferences unless it has been previously provided to me. However, I can provide general information about coffee blends.
Coffee blends can be made up of beans from different regions, with varying degrees of roast, to create a unique flavor profile. The origin of the beans used in a blend can affect the taste, as different regions produce beans with distinct flavor characteristics. For example, beans from Africa tend to have a fruity and floral taste, while beans from South America are more nutty and chocolaty.
Roasting techniques can also impact the flavor of a coffee blend. Light roasts tend to have a more acidic and fruity flavor, while dark roasts have a bolder, smokier taste. Medium roasts fall somewhere in between, with a balance of acidity and body.
The brewing method used to prepare the coffee can also affect the taste. For example, a French press will produce a full-bodied coffee with more sediment, while a pour-over will create a cleaner, more nuanced flavor.
As for additives and sweeteners, these can be added to taste. Some common options include sugar, cream, milk, honey, and flavored syrups."

28,AI,GPT-3,1.00,1.00,1.00,1.00,"# The Impact of Global Warming on the Environment
Global warming is a phenomenon that has been affecting the environment for decades. The increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere is causing significant changes in the climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity. In this report, we will discuss two significant effects of global warming on the environment and provide suggestions on how individuals and communities can take action to mitigate its effects.
## Effect 1: Melting of Glaciers and Rising Sea Levels
One of the most significant effects of global warming is the melting of glaciers and ice caps, which is causing sea levels to rise. According to NASA, sea levels have risen by approximately 8 inches (21 cm) since 1880, and the rate of rise is accelerating. This rise in sea levels is causing coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.
For example, in Bangladesh, rising sea levels are causing saltwater intrusion into the country's freshwater sources, which is affecting agriculture and drinking water supplies. In the United States, coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels is becoming more frequent and severe, causing damage to infrastructure and homes.
## Effect 2: Changes in Ecosystems and Biodiversity
Global warming is causing changes in ecosystems and biodiversity, which is affecting the survival of many species. For example, the Arctic sea ice is melting, causing polar bears to lose their habitat and food sources. The warmer temperatures are also causing coral reefs to bleach and die, which is affecting the marine ecosystem.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), up to 30% of species could be at risk of extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels.
## Mitigating the Effects of Global Warming
To mitigate the effects of global warming, individuals and communities can take action in several ways, including:
- Reducing carbon emissions by using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
- Conserving energy by using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and reducing car usage.
- Planting trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
- Supporting policies and initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability.
In conclusion, global warming is causing significant changes in the environment, including the melting of glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, and changes in ecosystems and biodiversity. To mitigate its effects, individuals and communities can take action by reducing carbon emissions, conserving energy, planting trees, and supporting sustainability initiatives."

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val length = 10
    val random = new Random()
    var result = """"
    var lastChar = """"
    for (i <- 1 to length) {
      var nextChar = """"
      if (lastChar == """") {
        // First character can be either a vowel or a consonant
        nextChar = if (random.nextBoolean()) vowels(random.nextInt(vowels.length)).toString else consonants(random.nextInt(consonants.length)).toString
      } else if (vowels.contains(lastChar)) {
        // Last character was a vowel, so next character must be a consonant
        nextChar = consonants(random.nextInt(consonants.length)).toString
      } else {
        // Last character was a consonant, so next character must be a vowel

      }
      result += nextChar
      lastChar = nextChar
    }
    println(result)
  }
}
```
This program generates a random string of length 10 that alternates between vowels and consonants. The first character can be either a vowel or a consonant, but subsequent characters must be the opposite of the previous character to ensure there are no consecutive consonants or vowels. The `Random` class is used to generate random indices into the `vowels` and `consonants` strings to select the next character. Finally, the generated string is printed to the console."

32,AI,GPT-3,0.54,1.00,1.00,1.00,"Yes, definitely. In C++, a try-catch block is used to handle exceptions that can occur during program execution. Exceptions are unexpected situations that occur while a program is running, such as an unexpected input or a division by zero. 
Here is an example where a try-catch block can be used to handle an unexpected outcome while ensuring the security of the system. Suppose you are writing a program that reads user input and performs a calculation on it. However, if the user inputs a negative number, the calculation could result in an overflow or underflow, which could potentially lead to a security vulnerability. 
To handle this situation, you can use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that occur when the user inputs a negative number. Here is an example code snippet:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
int main() {
    int num;
    std::cout << ""Enter a positive number: "";
    std::cin >> num;
    try {
        if (num < 0) {
            throw std::invalid_argument(""Negative number entered"");
        }
        // Perform calculation with num
    }
    catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cerr << ""Error: "" << e.what() << std::endl;
        // Handle the error securely
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, if the user inputs a negative number, the `throw` statement will throw an exception of type `std::invalid_argument`. The `catch` block then catches this exception and prints an error message to the console. You can then handle the error securely, such as by terminating the program or logging the error. 
By using a try-catch block, you can ensure that unexpected inputs or outcomes do not compromise the security of your program."

The carrot was a bright and lively root vegetable that lived nestled in the ground, soaking up the sun's rays and growing bigger and stronger each day. The snowman was a jolly fellow, made of snow and ice, always ready to play with the other animals in the forest. And the umbrella was a steadfast guardian, protecting the creatures of the forest from the rain and the wind.

One winter day, a terrible storm rolled in, bringing with it a thick blanket of snow that quickly covered the ground. The animals of the forest were all huddled together, shivering and cold, and the snowman knew he had to do something to help. He looked down at the carrot nestled at his feet and had an idea.

""Carrot, my friend, do you think you could help me build a shelter for our friends?"" he asked.

The carrot nodded eagerly and together, they began to gather branches and leaves from the ground. With the help of the other animals, they built a sturdy shelter to protect everyone from the storm.

But just as they finished, the wind picked up, howling through the trees and threatening to tear the shelter apart. That's when the umbrella stepped in.

""Hold on, friends, I've got this,"" the umbrella said, opening up wide and standing firm against the wind.

Thanks to the umbrella's strength and the teamwork of the snowman and the carrot, the animals of the forest were able to wait out the storm in safety and warmth. And when the storm finally passed, they all gathered together to celebrate, grateful for their friends who had helped them through the storm.

From that day on, the carrot, the snowman, and the umbrella were known as the heroes of the forest, always ready to lend a helping hand in times of need."

One day, while on a camping trip in a remote area, the family saw a strange light in the sky. It hovered above them for a while and then descended. As it got closer, the family could see that it was an alien spaceship!

The family was both excited and scared. They had never seen anything like it before. The spaceship was huge and made of an unknown, shiny material. It landed close to the family, and a door opened. A group of aliens appeared, gesturing for the family to come aboard.

The Johnson's hesitated at first, but their curiosity got the best of them. They took a deep breath and stepped into the spaceship. As soon as they got onboard, the ship took off, and they were headed into deep space.

Empathetic leaders are able to put themselves in others' shoes, understand their perspectives, and make genuine connections that foster a collaborative and productive work environment.

Empathetic leadership empowers individuals and creates teams that are stronger and more resilient. When leaders show empathy towards their team members, they foster an environment of trust and cooperation. This enables people to feel safe in sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback, and this, in turn, leads to better problem-solving, decision-making and innovation.

Empathy also plays a critical role in conflict resolution. Leaders who demonstrate empathy towards those involved in a conflict are better equipped to understand the underlying issues and emotions, and can work towards finding a resolution that is acceptable to all parties.

Overall, empathetic leadership leads to stronger relationships, increased productivity and a more positive work environment. It helps leaders better understand and respond to the needs of their team members, and creates a culture that inspires people to do their best work."

Riggs Bank will put money in a special fund to be managed by a Madrid-based charity, the Salvador Allende Foundation, which helps abused victims. The bank had been accused of illegally concealing Gen Pinochet's assets. More than 3,000 people were killed for political reasons under Gen Pinochet's regime, an official report says. Last month in a US court, Riggs Bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by Gen Pinochet and the government of Equatorial Guinea. On that occasion, it was ordered to pay a fine of $16m. Gen Pinochet himself has never been put on trial for human rights violations under his 1973-90 rule, despite several high-profile cases against him. He is now facing charges relating to the murder of one Chilean and the disappearance of nine others. He is also being investigated for tax evasion, tax fraud and embezzlement of state funds.
The general's opponents rejoiced at the settlement, which was agreed in a court in the Spanish capital, Madrid. A lawyer for the victims, Eduardo Contreras, told Reuters news agency: ""This demonstrates that the horrors of the Pinochet dictatorship are not a mystery to anyone and that the whole world knows his victims deserve reparations."" Riggs spokesman Mark Hendrix said the settlement, details of which will be announced next week, was an opportunity to move on. ""This enables the institution to put the matter behind us,"" he told Reuters. The settlement follows a legal complaint filed against the bank by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon alleging that it had illegally concealed assets.

The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. MPs and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the Lords. Tony Blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the Lords in Labour's manifesto.
But the all-party group, including Tories Ken Clarke and Sir George Young, Labour's Robin Cook and Tony Wright and Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a ""large majority"". And they list former Conservative leader William Hague and former Labour leader Neil Kinnock as supporters of the plans. The group says the British public and a clear majority of MPs support replacing the Lords with a largely-elected second chamber. Their plan would see the House of Lords being renamed the Second Chamber of Parliament, and its members would be known as MSCPs.
There would be 385 MSCPs, including 270 elected members, 87 appointed members and 16 bishops. They would serve for between 12 and 14 years. Mr Cook said holding elections for MSCPs on the same day as those for MPs might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout. He added: ""Over the last year I have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice. ""What could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our Parliament?""
The group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable. It wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a ""largely democratic"" second chamber in their manifestos. Mr Clarke said the issue ""went to the heart of reforming the health of the British political system"". And Mr Tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the Lords was flawed. ""The problem, I think, in the prime minister's mind is there doesn't appear to be a consensus that includes him,"" he said. ""We are providing a consensus"". The Elect the Lords Campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate. ""We believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny,"" said co-ordinator Peter Facey. ""In lieu of any other such clear proposals, the government must permit that to happen."""

The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called LokiTorrent closed down. It is the latest network which uses the peer-to-peer system called BitTorrent to be hit by the MPAA. The MPAA began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in December. A Dallas court agreed that Hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to LokiTorrent's server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. In October 2004, the site had provided links to more than 30,000 files. The action came after the operators of LokiTorrent agreed a settlement with the MPAA. A stark message has appeared on the site from the MPAA warning ""You can click, but you can't hide"". In BitTorrent systems, server sites do not host the files being shared. They host links, called ""trackers"" that direct people to others that have it instead.
As well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the US, the MPAA said it had given operators that host eDonkey servers ""take down"" notices. Hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on file-sharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and TV programmes then share the files online. But it is now targeting the operators of BitTorrent networks themselves. It has filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server sites since December. The strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt file-sharers' ability to swap content using BitTorrent systems. The film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and DVDs already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal file-sharing is adding to their losses. In December, the legal action claimed its most high-profile victim. The popular Suprnova.org website was forced to close, and others like Phoenix Torrent followed soon after."

Chief executive Gail Berman said ""in the case of this fall we drifted to too much on the unscripted side"". The series Who's Your Daddy, where a young woman tries to pick her natural father for a cash prize caused outrage from adoption groups and rated badly. Last season, Fox's prime-time audience fell by 600,000 to 5.9 million. Ms Berman said: ""I think the audience expects loud things from Fox. Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't.""
Who's Your Daddy, the first episode of which was shown on 3 January, pulled in a disappointing audience of 6.3 million, according to the Nielsen ratings system. Five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from Fox's schedules, Ms Berman said. She was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the network's established reality shows, such as American Idol, which is due to start its fourth series this week. Fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season, including the traditionally quiet summer season.

Overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a Christmas hit like last year's Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings. Traditionally, ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. According to Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.
""Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,"" said Mr Dergarabedian. He added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as Napoleon Dynamite and critical hit Sideways. Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year.

61,Human,BBC,0.00,0.00,0.05,0.00,"Indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the Paris Club group of creditors, Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie has reportedly said.
Indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the Paris Club about $48bn (ÃÂ£25.5bn). Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. This aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. Most of this 'normal aid' would be used to finance the country's budget deficit. The Indonesian Economics Minister explained that the money - $1.2bn in grants and $500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of Aceh province, which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 December. Nevertheless, one of Mr Bakrie's deputies, Mahendra Siregar, told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. ""What is true is that we are still discussing... the Paris Club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. That's how far we are at this stage,"" said Mr Siregar.
The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami. Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles accepted the Paris Club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. Thailand and India have however declined the offer, with Thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while India said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. Putting off payments may lower a country's rating among financial organisations, making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future, analysts said. Separately, the Indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. Welfare Minister Alwi Shihab told AP news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations."

""If I am to compete in it, it is only if I feel I can win,"" said the 30-year-old, who is retiring in 2006. ""Otherwise there is not much point in me going."" El Guerrouj achieved a lifetime ambition last August when he clinched his first Olympic titles over 1500m and 5,000m. But the four-time world 1500m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career. The 30-year-old has set his sights on clinching the world 5,000m crown in Helsinki this summer. And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele's 5,000m and 10,000m world records.
El Guerrouj could meet Bekele in March as the Ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses.

Mr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2's Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour's controversial poster campaign. He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a ""silly fuss"". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour's election campaign.
The e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from ""demonising"" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour's advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.
Mr Campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA's boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: ""Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!"" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.
He said: ""Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. ""Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. ""Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. ""Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.""
Later the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell's use of abusive language. The spokesman said: ""The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government."" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had ""very good and polite relations"" with Mr Campbell, who he described as ""very talented"". But on the former spin doctor's use of language, Mr Straw said: ""I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists."" Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new ""sinister and underhand tactics"" by Labour."

Wales, on the other hand, have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.
Kevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. In the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones bas been brought on the blind-side flank to beef up the Wales back row in place of Jonathan Thomas. Wales coach Mike Ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship. ""Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right,"" said Ruddock. ""That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week.""
Despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions France are also unbeaten. Under-pressure coach Bernard Laporte has made four changes, with Yannick Nyanga, the debutant Julien Laharrague, Aurelien Rougerie and Yannick Jauzion coming into the side. France have been criticised for the absence of traditional ""French flair"" as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain Fabien Pelous sees hope on the horizon.

Last month, the German exchange tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for LSE, valuing it at ÃÂ£1.3bn. Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE. Euronext is due to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to raise ÃÂ£1.4bn to fund a bid. Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore is scheduled to meet his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche Boerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting Ms Furse on Thursday, in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December.
The LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed ÃÂ£1.3bn offer in December, saying it undervalued the business.
But it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a ""significantly-improved proposal"" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: ""There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made."" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.
According to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of London and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. Its ownership of Clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees."
66,Human,BBC,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.38,"The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.
The trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to children from other countries. Children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. But the Home Office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities.
The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.
Since 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.
Under the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the ""best interest"" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.
""If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,"" she said. ""We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania]. 'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision."" In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing ""the difficult issue"" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children ""and leave them to rot"". ""We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,"" said the spokesman. ""We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.
""We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities."" The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. ""From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,"" said Mr Hogg. ""In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. ""The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries."" A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries."

We've called for the state pension to be increased from ÃÂ£79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of ÃÂ£105.45. That's what we're calling for. Many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.
We've drawn up a pensioners' manifesto. This will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. Once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. It's our way of putting the politicians on notice. We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. Before 1997 most pensioners voted Conservative. In 1997 and 2001 they voted Labour. But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around. They cannot take that vote for granted.
Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue. He said the UK had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.
That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.
We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs. Various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. We don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out.
It is hard to say whether we will be successful. We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.
Repealing the Hunting Bill.
We are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action. We are hoping to hear in the New Year. Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. When the ban comes into force on 18 February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid. So there's a lot of legal territory to go. We are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. Whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (Rural affairs minister) Alun Michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. It is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.
It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face. It's exactly what the prime minister did not want. He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.
People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. It is another sort of form of shooting for sport. The principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant.
We will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK. We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors. With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.
I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure. But it will mobilise public opinion. Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.
The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. Choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.
Firstly, we have our website. It features our campaigns and changes every day. Secondly through our 700,000 members who communicate with us. Thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. We will invite the opinion formers, MPs, journalists and others. The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.
I think we will be successful. It's very much the language being used by the main political parties. Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.
Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. We have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that Gordon Brown has been postponing and postponing. Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about ÃÂ£750. If you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that.
If fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and I would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. What it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business.
We will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. But they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work."

The Sunday Telegraph said the LSE's plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny. Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer. A ÃÂ£1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of ÃÂ£1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the ÃÂ£1.5bn mark. Neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE's managed bid process.
Despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the LSE's board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse's ÃÂ£1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE's decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period. Meanwhile, the German exchange's offer has come under fire recently. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. Others claim it will weaken the city's status as Europe's financial centre, while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions. LSE shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation, weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive."

73,Human,BBC,0.00,0.00,0.54,0.13,"The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.
Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries. Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: ""[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. ""It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal."" Mr Solana's comments come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.
Under the Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in British jails without trial or charge. Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.
Some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. Human Rights group Liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial. But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. But Mr Clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal. He has opted for a system of ""control orders"" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. These orders will again involve a UK opt-out of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The West End landmark was turned into a festive landscape complete with snow and carol singers to celebrate the arrival of the animated film. ""This is Leicester Square like you've never seen it before,"" said Hanks, who plays five roles in the movie. Polar Express is based on a children's book which tells the story of a young boy's journey to meet Santa Claus. The 48-year-old actor crossed a three-metre high bridge built in the square, which he said was ""almost impossible to get across"". Hundreds of fans greeted the star, all wearing Santa hats, and mince pies were on offer. Hanks said that the new film has an ""elegant message"". ""Christmas is a special time of the year and you get out of it what you put into it,"" added the two-time Academy Award winner.
""I believe in the spirit of Christmas and I think that's embodied in Santa Claus,"" he said. Polar Express uses technology similar to that used in Lord of the Rings to bring Gollum to life. The ""performance capture"" technique enables Hanks to play a number of roles, including the eight-year-old boy who is at the centre of the story, and Father Christmas. It is directed by Robert Zemeckis, who has previously worked with Hanks on Forrest Gump and Castaway."

Likely they will be loosely related to ethical socialism, but the problem with regular hard left socialist thought is that quite simply, in the field of economics its defenses as anything able to be tried easily in modern day is not very strong. (Assuming that you're not counting social market economies as socialism). That being said, the balance here is that one should still march in that direction, but in a cautious manner that prevents people from emotionally making leaps that are not for the best long term. Since something being ethically preferable does not actually make it realistic, though it will help frame into context what one should look at. Socially one would obviously not consider abstract appeals to freedom to heavily outweigh beneficial societal projects. Though one might disagree about what qualifies here, and more importantly what times one thinks that there's an obvious better answer for.  Note that one thing that might set consequentialists apart is that they will look at both what is reasonable to do right now versus what will be in the future, and by extension how to get there. Some things may be for the best in one time period even if once society marches on they are not. Ironically, making marching society forward another important goal, rather than looking only at the present. So there isn't necessarily one true set of laws and economic ideals that always holds true. At the same time, one must still be cautious to not presume one knows more about some hypothetical future state than you have the required gnosis to act in."

They are calculating machines that perform various basic logical operations on binary values, and it is up to the programmers to use that in performing higher level logic.  For example, the basic logical operations a CPU can perform are AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and NAND. These kinds of things are physically created ""gates"" within the structure of the CPU.  An AND gate will take two inputs and output a signal only if both of the two inputs have a signal on them. An OR gate will provide an output signal if either or both of the inputs has a signal. A NOT gate will provide the opposite output as the input signal. XOR will provide an output signal if only one of the inputs has a signal but not if both do. Finally the NAND gate will provide an output signal if there is no input signal and if either of the two inputs has a signal, but not if both inputs have a signal.  As you can see these kinds of basic functions are difficult to work with in creating a complex program without many layers of abstraction. Programmers tend to work using programming languages that summarize and convert combinations of these basic binary operations into a format more easily understood and written by a human. For a computer to do anything with this it needs to be ""compiled"", a process that takes this readable set of instructions and converts it into a form the CPU can process.  The readable set of instructions is the source code while the compiled code is what is actually distributed to end users. Programs exist to try to de-compile programs but context, comments (notes to explain what is being done and why), variable names, formatting, and other things helpful for understanding what a program is doing are not available. For a program that might have 80 million lines of code, not having the source code makes figuring out how things are working behind the scenes quite difficult."

All the boring head are flat, those machines are differentiated by the cutting method and material extraction.  Edit: why the head could never be conical: the top priority is avoiding the earth/mud to collapse in the machine and being extracted. That is why most head have (EPB/Slurry) have âsmallâ openings on the face with a bigger passage in the middle. There is absolutely not extraction on the periphery, and the head thickness is has small as possible. A conical face would mean scrapped raw material would have to extracted all around the head and the gravity would mean that earth on top of the machine would naturally fall inside the head uncontrolled and just destroy everything on top. It would increase tenfold the torque necessary for rotation, and a 6m flat head is already around 6000kN.m the speed of the machine is partly due to the scraping capacity,  but mainly how quickly you can removing the material extracted while controlling that ONLY the material in front of the machine is extracted, control is always more important than speed. There some Japanese machine with large opening and high speed but they really need favorable ground to able to work (only earth, not sand, no water, no rock, stability of the top ground etc, cannot drill too deep.  A machine will conical head could not even be able to start boring before collapsing everything.  3. Slurry means you plan to bore mainly in mud, sand or other similar soft with important water penetration. Meeting any kind of big rock is a huge problem as it may destroy all the tooling. The material extraction is done by injecting of a special kind of mud (the slurry) which is injected under pressure inside the first 10cm on the cutting face. It helps at two level, it creates a consistent area of mud for the carbure tool to scrape and create a bubble hermetic to air and water to maintain the cutting area pressure. Maintaining the pressure is very important because he slurry is extracted using a hydraulic circuit with huge pumps (~600kW each) in series which move the mix slurry + mud + sand + small rock on top of the site. If the bubble breaks two possibilities: pressure from the machine was too high, the machine will stop moving but nothing much will happen, pressure from the machine was too low, in that case you may create collapse of the river/building/bridge on top, in worst case scenario you can lose the whole machine and project and cause major building collapse. On top there is slurry traitement plant which extracts the slurry to late re-inject in the circuit. At the bottom of the cutting head is huge rock crusher which reduce most kind of rocks into small pebbles.  3. EPB is the same as slurry but there less or no water involved. Less need to maintain pressure in front. The extract is usually close to atmospheric pressure and there is only a hermetic screw conveyor which both move the raw material and adjust the pressure. The main trick with thing kind of machine is designing the right kind of head, guessing the size of the rock, the chance of meeting a underground water river/lake, the chance a meeting Ã  gaz pocket, the % of sand compare to earth. It will change the size of openings, the types and number of carbure cutters, and type system treatment of the soil. Once the head is fixed, then you have to design the treatment of the soil. Most EPB will use special kind of foam, again it is used to create a small pressure bubble to avoid collapse of all the buildings above (note: most city metro used EPB to bore the tunnel) and avoid creating fronti (total collapse), the foam is also here for protecting the tooling and lubrification in the conveyor screw. EPB Is the most common kind of machine and the cheapest  4. EPB is historically the first type of boring machine. The slurry machine is much more technologically demanding and was created to answer the drilling in high water situation.  5. Hard rock machines are an entirely different beast altogether. The idea there is not to scrap or âcutâ the front face. At the start point of the tunnel is created a flat surface of rock which will be used as the initial cutting face. The cutting head is quite full, with hundreds of steel rollers (diameter around 200~250mm) instead of scrapper. Each roller has an individual path on the cutting face and the distance between each path is calculated depending on the type of rock (during functioning the cutting face looks like hundreds of concentrical lines). The aim is to create small rock chips without creating too much dust. The power of the machine is quite low but the head rotation is the highest. Those machines still generate a huge amount of dust and vibrations. Compensation for the vibrations is vey important or the machine will dismantle itself in a few days. The risk when drill in rock is meeting a pocket of gaz or water. Each of those may fill the tunnel in a few minutes and kill everyone. Compare to other boring machine where the apparition is slow and progressive, here invasions are very very sudden.  A 6m diameter EPB boring head typically has a torque around 6000kN.m"

Itâs basically what others have already said, but, since you didnât specify a language, I wanted to add that English scholars tend to be more descriptivist, so English evolves fast, as grammatical âerrorsâ become accepted. Descriptivism roughly means the standard for the language readily accommodates the way speakers form the language. For instance, the philosophy of many dictionary companies in English is to *describe* the meaning of words as theyâre used, not to ascribe meaning to them. So, what is considered the English *language* evolves fast.  Some other languages, like my native Spanish, have a more prescriptive nature. We have what are called âacademies of the language,â which are basically offshoots in almost every Spanish speaking country of the one and only Spanish Royal Academy in Spain. They all *prescribe* or dictate speakers how to speak the language. Actually, the motto of the Royal  Academy is to âpurify, fix, and dignifyâ the whole of the Spanish language. So, the standard for Spanish doesnât really accommodate for *peoplespeak*. Ours is a very slowly evolving language by design, with the elites fixed in their purpose that all Spanish speakers be able to read Cervantes in its original form.

93,Human,SHP_reddit,0.00,0.00,0.70,0.00,"This is a great question, and perhaps more complex than it appears. The notion of Appalachian isolation, in a true sense, has been the subject of much debate. Cratis Williams and Wilma Dunaway each contend, to one extent or another, that our idea of complete or mostly complete isolation in Appalachia is, very generally speaking, false. This misapprehension may, perhaps, be laid at the feet of the exploitative media practices which emphasized the idea of an isolated and fundamentally backward Appalachian region through âlocal-colorâ pieces and, eventually, film and television for profit. Whatever the reason for the trope, it is quite likely that it is, at best, an exaggeration and over-generalization of the actual state of the region. Dunaway argues that Appalachia has been economically connected to the world (meaning national and international trade) from settlement on. Williams outright states that the average Appalachian homestead was no more isolated than any other frontier settlement. By the time we reach the 19th century, we can be fairly confident that, with some few exceptions, the region was not as isolated as it has been portrayed. We can safely say that parts of the region were more isolated than others - even if the character of that isolation was relative rather than absolute throughout most of the region.   .    However, this raises an important question: Appalachia is huge! Even limiting it to the mountains of the former confederate South means dealing with a daunting level of diversity. So, where are we talking about? Since you asked about the more isolated hills of Georgia, Iâll address that. But, be aware that what is true of Northeast Georgia is not necessarily true of other parts of the region.    .   When we speak of the more isolated parts of Appalachian Georgia during the war, we must really discuss Northeast Georgia. The Northwestern part of the state was both more well connected to urban confederate centers (like nearby Chattanooga and Atlanta) and saw a great deal of direct action. I think that we can agree that the central and southern parts of the state, despite also seeing various amounts of action during the war, are neither geographically nor culturally part of Appalachia (difficult as the boundaries of the region can be to define). So, Iâll confine my answer to the Northeast (think: the region near the Ocoee and Oconee rivers that includes Fannin county, Copper Hill, Dahlonega, Helen [of cabbage patch fame], and still more rural locales).    .   To begin, youâll want to remember that a more rural area with the sort of ridge and valley topography that is characteristic of Northern Georgia was not well suited to the mass agriculture projects which may initially come to mind when thinking about the confederate south - meaning that large plantations (with many slaves) were not the economic drivers that they were in areas with flatter terrain. When one considers this, as well as the rurality of the region and the hostility with which confederate draft officials were often met there, it is little wonder that residents of the region were less likely to be directly involved in, or materially supportive of, the war (in a large sense) than other Georgians. That isnât meant to imply that the area was ignorant of the war nor that the people who lived there were uniformly opposed to it. Rural counties in the Northeast still supplied troops and (a smaller amount of) war material to the confederate army. (Though, at a guess, it seems more likely that they were more often supplying those goods that they did send to their fellow Georgians rather than the larger confederate forces given Governor Brownâs tendency to put Georgia and her needs before those of the confederacy.)   .    In short, it is probably safe to make the general claim that most of the average residents of rural Northeast Georgia were aware of the war and were, collectively via county governments, involved in supporting the war. It is impossible to prove the negative and say that there were no communities or individual households, in either Northeast Georgia or the more broadly constructed Appalachian South, which were ignorant of the conflict. However, given the engagement of even these rural areas on the county and municipal levels, it seems very very unlikely that you would find large pockets of such ignorance of either the war or the areaâs secession.    .   Thanks for the great question! For good arguments about Appalachian connections to international trade (and therefore a refutation of the notion of a more absolute regional isolation), Dunawayâs The First American Frontier is a good read. Likewise, just about anything you find by Williams is worth reading, though his The Southern Mountaineer In Fact And Fiction, and the excerpted âWho Are The Southern Mountaineers?â are great (if more than a bit dated now). A good bit of follow up reading on the war in Northeast Georgia should probably include Sarrisâ A Seperate Civil War."
