CNN — Rep. George Santos has pleaded not guilty to 13 federal charges, including allegations of fraud related to Covid-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports.

Santos was released on a $500,000 bond, according to the US Attorney’s Office in New York. He was ordered to surrender his passport and will need permission to travel outside of Washington, DC, New York City and Long Island.

The New York Republican appeared in a federal court on Long Island on Wednesday. He has been charged on seven counts of wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, one count of theft of public funds and two counts of making materially false statements to the House of Representatives.

In a combative, impromptu press conference after his arraignment, Santos said that he has been “compliant throughout this entire process” but blasted the indictment as a “witch hunt” and said he will “fight my battle.”

The charges inject fresh uncertainty into the political future of Santos, a freshman congressman whose astonishing pattern of lies and fabrications stunned even hardened politicos and led top Democrats and some New York Republicans to call for his resignation earlier this year.

The congressman said on Wednesday that he will not resign from his seat and that he still plans to seek reelection next year.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said Wednesday he would wait before calling on Santos to resign.

“It always concerns me,” McCarthy told CNN after being informed of the money laundering and wire fraud charges.

“He will go through his time in trial and let’s find out how the outcome is,” McCarthy added.

Later, the speaker said he will not support Santos’ reelection, telling CNN that “Santos has a lot going on. I think he has other things to focus on in his life other than running for reelection.”

McCarthy confirmed that if the Ethics Committee determines Santos broke the law, he would call for him to resign.

Prosecutors allege Santos, 34, solicited campaign funds under false pretense and used them for personal expenses like designer clothing.

The indictment accuses Santos of undertaking a “fraudulent political contribution solicitation scheme,” alleging that he set up a company and got supporters to contribute funds to it under the false pretense that the money would benefit his political campaign.

“Taken together, the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself,” said US Attorney Breon Peace in a statement. “He used political contributions to line his pockets, unlawfully applied for unemployment benefits that should have gone to New Yorkers who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and lied to the House of Representatives.”

Santos, who was elected last year to represent a district that includes parts of Long Island and Queens, has been under investigation in multiple jurisdictions and by the House Ethics Committee. The congressman has admitted to making some misleading claims about his education and financial status but continues to deny the more serious allegations. He has not admitted any crimes.

He was taken into custody in Melville, a law enforcement source told CNN. From there, he was taken to the courthouse in Central Islip.
