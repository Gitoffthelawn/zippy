The White House declined to weigh in on the unsealing of a 13-count indictment that alleges Republican Rep. George Santos made false statements on multiple financial disclosure declarations.

“It’s a case that we’re not going to speak to — the Justice Department is independent, and we respect that,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with the President to Westchester County in New York on Wednesday.

In addition to charges he lied in financial disclosures, Santos was also accused of fraudulently applying for Covid-19 relief funds and committing wire fraud.

Jean-Pierre deferred to the House Republican conference when pressed about the possibility of the GOP representative getting expelled from Congress.
