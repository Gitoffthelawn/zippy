I am a person who lives in rural CO, I like living in rural areas, probably because when I was little I grew up in rural VT. 
I am 33 years old, I have a dog namd Dusty who I walk multiple times each day. Today I ran to the fire station to do the pack test then ran home. 
It started snowing today so I started a fire in the wood stove which is heating the house nicely as it is supposed to get quite cold this evening.
