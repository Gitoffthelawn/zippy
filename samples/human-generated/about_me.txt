I am a person who lives in rural CO, I like living in rural areas, probably because when I was little I grew up in rural VT. 
I am 33 years old, I have a dog namd Dusty who I walk multiple times each day. Today I ran to the fire station to do the pack test then ran home. 
It started snowing today so I started a fire in the wood stove which is heating the house nicely as it is supposed to get quite cold this evening.

When I was in middle school I moved to The Netherlands and went to school there (International school of Amsterdam), I had to ride my bike there every
day, it was almost 4 km each way. While at the time it was tough for me to say goodbye to my friends from VT (the only I'd ever known), it was, upon
reflection an immensely valuable life experience to see how other people and other cultures lived. I was also able to pick up een beetje Nederlands!
