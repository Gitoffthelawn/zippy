Follow your Asthma Action Plan
Keep your asthma under control by following your asthma action plan.
Avoid your asthma triggers.
Continue current medications, including any inhalers with steroids in them (“steroids” is another word for corticosteroids). Know how to use your inhaler.
Do not stop any medications or change your asthma treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.
Talk to your healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications, such as asthma inhalers. Make sure that you have 30 days of non-prescription medications and supplies on hand in case you need to stay home for a long time.
Be careful around cleaning agents and disinfectants
Follow the recommendations below to reduce your chance of an asthma attack while cleaning. Follow recommendations for cleaning your home and in your facility.
Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home

If you have asthma:
Ask an adult without asthma to clean and disinfect surfaces and objects for you.
Stay in another room when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use.
Use cleaning agents and disinfectant only when necessary. In routine situations, high-touch surfaces and objects might be cleaned effectively with soap and water.
Make a list of the urgent care or health facilities near you that provides nebulizer/asthma treatments and keep it close to your phone.
If you have an asthma attack, move away from the trigger, such as the cleaning agent or disinfectant or the area that was disinfected. Follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.
The person cleaning and disinfecting should:
Choose disinfectants that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s list of approved products, such as:
Products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Ensure that products with hydrogen peroxide do not contain other chemicals that can trigger asthma attacks such as peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid.
Limit use of chemicals that can trigger asthma attacks, such as bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds (for example, benzalkonium chloride), and do not use them in enclosed spaces.
Follow additional precautions for cleaning and disinfecting places where people with asthma might be, to reduce exposure to asthma triggers.
Use products safely and correctly:
Always read and follow the directions on the product label to ensure you are using it safely and effectively.
Wear skin protection such as gloves and consider eye protection to protect yourself against splashes.
Make sure there is enough air flow (ventilation).
Use only the amount recommended on the label.
Use water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label).
Do NOT mix chemical products. Label diluted cleaning solutions.
Spray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows).
Store products safely and correctly
Store and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets.
Label diluted cleaning solutions.
Follow EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Use.
