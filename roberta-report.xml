In the fall of 2013, the enrollment was over 300 students.\n\nThe school started with the first graduating class of 2002. They are now on their 11th graduating class, and the school's graduates continue to receive acceptance to universities across the United States. The school offers several Advanced Placement classes.\n\nGlacier Ridge has had its students participate in various competitions and competitions. Most notable are the sports teams, especially their basketball teams, which have qualified for state competition multiple times. The school has also had various music groups participate in state and regional competitions, and in the 2010-2011 school year, the school sent students to participate in an International Children's Games competition in Romania.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 school year, a group of the school's teachers were sent to Haiti to help establish a new orphanage, &quot;Eli's Children's House&quot;, which was dedicated to Eli Pierre, who had died in a motorcycle accident. They were instrumental in bringing the orphanage into the community by helping establish new programs for the children, including English as a Second Language, Computer Lab, and Physical Education classes. The teachers assisted in the education of the orphans as well as working with the staff on the property.\n\nThe school has also taken various trips over the years, including trips to Virginia and New York City. The school also hosted an educational trip to Washington D.C. for one of their graduating classes.\n\nThe school has participated in various community events and service projects. One of the most notable is their annual &quot;Twilight Prom&quot; that is held each spring. Each year, the school hosts a prom for local high school students who have special needs. The students' dates are typically their own siblings.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, a fire destroyed the school's auditorium, causing over $1 million in damages. After the school received an outpouring of support, the school was able to begin construction on a new auditorium in time for the next school year.\n\nIn 2015, Glacier Ridge Christian School became part of the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\nThe School is affiliated with the Association of Christian Schools International, the Ohio Christian Education Association, and the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\n]" time="1.354"><properties><property name="score" value="0.999787708123525" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season\n\nThe 2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season, part of college football in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division I Football Championship Subdivision level, began on September 6, 2003, and concluded with the National Championship Game of the NCAA Division I Football Championship on December 21, 2003, at Finley Stadium in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord.&quot;\n\nEzekiel 33:11-11\n\nGod wants every sinner to be saved. He does not want people to perish but be saved. God hates sin, and sin destroys a person. But He loves people. He created them to have fellowship with Him and one day live in His Kingdom, and He does not want that for one person to be lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod's command to Ezekiel was that He was telling him to go and tell the people of Israel that they need to turn to God, because they were going to die if they did not. We know that Ezekiel told them the same thing, because God's word is truth. God's Word does not fail.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat God is saying is that people are going to die if they do not turn to Him. People who reject God will die. The Bible says in Romans 1:32, &quot;Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.&quot; God says that those people who do these things deserve death, and yet people continue to do them and approve of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod will not tolerate the sinful acts of humanity, but He wants every person to be saved. There is only one way to be saved. The Bible says in John 14:6, &quot;Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one can be saved except through Jesus Christ, but when people put Jesus as their savior, they are saved. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many people who call themselves Christians who say that God wants everyone to be saved, and they quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, but they don't realize that God's word is truth. God says in Revelation 21:8, &quot;But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars\u2014their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one way to be saved, and it is not through anyone or anything but Jesus Christ. Jesus is the only way to heaven. God says that all the people who are going to perish are going to go to a place called the second death. That's hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, they don't realize that God's word is truth. They don't realize that when they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are not telling the truth. When they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are putting God in a box, because God's word is truth. God says that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior are going to perish. God's word is truth, and people who do not put their faith in Jesus Christ are going to die.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bible says in John 14:6, &quot;Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus is the only way to the Father, and no one can be saved except through Him. He died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead on the third day, and He sits at the right hand of God, interceding for us. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at Ezekiel 33:11-11, and read it carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says that He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. God does not like it when people die. But God hates sin, and sin leads to death. If people want to live, they must turn from their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf people don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. God doesn't want that. He doesn't want people to perish, but to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod wants people to put their faith in Jesus Christ. If people put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are saved. If they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. That's the truth.

I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Do you think I take pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord.

Let's say I have the following array of numbers:\n\nvar myNumbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\nThe following snippet of code would display the same numbers in reverse order:\n\nfor ( var i = myNumbers.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i-- ) { console.log( myNumbers[i] ); }\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nWe know that the index of an array can be used as a &quot;pointer&quot; to the location in memory that contains a particular item in an array. If the array myNumbers has five items, then myNumbers[0] , myNumbers[1] , myNumbers[2] , myNumbers[3] and myNumbers[4] will point to the values 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nIn the previous example, the code starts with the length of the array (5) and subtracts one from it. As we know that index 0 in an array contains the first item in the array, the previous code will execute the following steps:\n\nTake the length of the array (5) Subtract 1 (so we now have 4) Start at the index that contains the first item in the array (myNumbers[4] = 3) and run down the array until we reach the last item in the array (myNumbers[3] = 5)\n\nSo the above code will end up displaying the items in the array in reverse order, starting at index 4 and working backwards to index 0.\n\nAt this point, we have a good idea of how we can access the values in an array in a specific order, but how do we go the other way?\n\nIt would be great if we could simply use the same code as above, but add a &quot;--&quot; operator before the last number. That way, we could add a simple parameter to the code to control the range of numbers it will use.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't do that. While JavaScript will happily work with -- , it will also happily take -- in code and convert it to -1 , or the last number in an array. That's not going to do us any good, as we want the code to be flexible enough that we can work with a number that we specify as the range of numbers.\n\nSo let's look at a simple function that can give us the results we need.\n\nfunction rotate(numbers, direction, number) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push(number); numbers.unshift(number); };\n\nThe rotate function above has three parameters, and will rotate the values in the numbers array.\n\nnumbers is the array we want to use.\n\ndirection is the parameter that allows us to choose whether we want the values to be rotated in the direction we specify. In this case, we've chosen direction to be either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;\n\nnumber is the number we're using as the upper bound of the range that we want to use.\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\n\nAs we can see, the numbers array is simply rotated right by the number we specified. That's fine, but let's add in some code that we can use to control which numbers are displayed:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 1 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 4, 3, 5, 2 ]\n\nWe can see that we've rotated the numbers so that the first number in the array is now number 1 , and the next number in the array is 4 .\n\nWe've also specified that we want to rotate in a right-handed manner, by passing &quot;right&quot; as the second parameter. This means that we have access to the following rotation values:\n\nrotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; );\n\nIf we try to access the rotate function with &quot;left&quot; as the parameter, we'll see the following output:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nNot quite what we wanted, right?\n\nWhat we want is to be able to take an array, specify the number of numbers we want to display, and be able to choose the direction of rotation.\n\nWe also want to ensure that the values we are displaying are always within the array's bounds, and we're using them correctly.\n\nThe good news is that it's not too difficult to do this. We simply need to know what we want the code to look like, and write the code to do what we want it to do.\n\nLet's take a look at some simple code to display the numbers in an array in a given direction:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nrotateArray function\n\nThis is the code we'll use to display the numbers in the numbers array in the direction we specify. We'll start with a simple parameter:\n\nstartAt is the number we're displaying. It can either be the first number in the array, or any number within the array.\n\nLet's take a look at the code again:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing this simple function, we can take any number of numbers, and display them in the direction we want. Let's look at a quick example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;left&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nThis time, we've used &quot;left&quot; as the direction, and we've also used the parameter &quot;3&quot; as the startAt value. The result is that we now have the numbers displayed in the array starting at the number 3 .\n\nIf we use a number that isn't within the bounds of the array, we'll get the following result:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nAs you can see, the direction we've specified is &quot;right&quot;, and the value we've specified for startAt is 3 . Unfortunately, this value isn't within the bounds of the array, so the values in the array have been displayed starting from the last number in the array.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can use this code to work with a number that's outside the bounds of the array:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 6 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nThis time, we've specified &quot;right&quot; as the direction, and a value of 6 as the startAt parameter. The result is that we now have the values displayed in the array starting at the number 6 .\n\nThis time, the result we want is displayed in the array, but there's a problem. We don't want the number 6 to be the start of the array. Instead, we want it to be the last number in the array.\n\nThe good news is that we can easily handle this by modifying the code slightly:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing the simple rotation code above, we can now take any array, specify the number we want to display, and choose the direction we want to use. This means we can write some simple code that can work with any number, regardless of its position in the array.\n\nThe next step is to write some code that can ensure the number we specify as the startAt is in the range that we expect.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can do that:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { if( startAt &gt;= numbers.length ) { throw new RangeError(&quot;Start at is outside of the]" time="4.527"><properties><property name="score" value="0.995492330619267" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Contents\n\n1. The Meaning of Love\n\n2. Our Attitude Toward Others\n\n3. The Two Great Commandments\n\n4. Developing Love\n\n5. How to Help Others\n\n6. The Golden Rule\n\n7. The Commandments in the New Testament\n\n8. Tolerance\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Meaning of Love\n\nBefore we can love others, we must know the meaning of love. It is important to love God and obey Him and to have a right relationship with Him. But to have a right relationship with Him we must love Him. That means that we must have a good relationship with all His laws.\n\nOf course we can't keep all the commandments all the time. Yet we must have a good relationship with them. Otherwise we will not know what God is like.\n\nLove is based on God's law.\n\nRomans 13:10. The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nGalatians 5:14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nLove is based on God's law. We should study God's commandments and know the laws He has given us. Then we will know how to have a good relationship with Him.\n\nOne reason we are to love God and obey Him is that it is important to have a good relationship with God. We need to know how much God loves us. Without knowing this we cannot have a right relationship with God. We need to have a good relationship with Him so we can be happy and serve Him better.\n\nLet us understand what love is.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nIn these verses John explained that love is the opposite of lawlessness. Love is the opposite of murder, hatred, malice, evil, adultery, stealing, lying, and a lot of other bad things.\n\nRomans 13:8-10. Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law. For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\n\nWe learn from this that the opposite of love is lawlessness. The opposite of love is murder, hatred, envy, malice, evil, and all the other things mentioned in these verses.\n\nVerse 10 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; In other words, love is a good thing. It is a good thing to have a good relationship with God.\n\nRomans 13:8 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; Love helps and blesses others.\n\nLove is a good thing. The reason love is a good thing is because God is love.\n\n1 John 4:16. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love; and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.\n\nVerse 8 says, &quot;God is love.&quot; God's name is Love.\n\nGod's name is Love.\n\nJohn 4:8. \u2026 the well was deep; and I said, &quot;How shall I get down?&quot;\n\nAnd he said, &quot;Come, and I will show you.&quot;\n\n9. And he said, &quot;Draw you [a] little water out of the well, and \u2026 drink.&quot;\n\n10. And I said, &quot;Sir, give me [a] little to drink.&quot;\n\n11. And he said, &quot;Drink, my [b] son, and \u2026 your eyes shall be opened.&quot;\n\n12. And I drank, and it was as if I had had new vision given to me; for I could see [c] through those walls of water.\n\n13. And he said to me, &quot;Go [a] down, for the water is [b] yet a little way below the earth. \u2026\n\n15. \u2026 This water is [c] that which I said \u2026 will make you come up hither.&quot;\n\n16. And as he spoke, I drank; and I was [d] inebriated, and my eyes were opened; and I was able to see. \u2026\n\n19. \u2026 &quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;follow me \u2026 and I will give you \u2026 rest.&quot;\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:9. \u2026 God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nGod is our salvation. God is our rest. God is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\n1 Peter 2:6. \u2026 you may be \u2026 a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.\n\nGod is our first fruits.\n\n2 Timothy 2:13. If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he cannot deny himself.\n\nGod is faithful.\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nHebrews 4:10-13. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his own works, as God did from His. Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest \u2026\n\n12. \u2026 For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\n13. \u2026 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 3:16,18. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\n\n19. But whoso has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nThe Bible says that God is love.\n\nWe can study love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.

Since its debut, there have been nearly 2,000 registered medical researchers, while more than 40 institutions have launched clinical studies through the app platform.\n\n\n\nBut there are several hurdles for Apple and its partners. On Wednesday, Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, will join at a panel discussion at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to examine what works and what\u2019s missing in the fast-evolving field of mobile health.\n\n\n\nThe session, titled \u201cWhat Are the Future Directions for ResearchKit?\u201d comes after a first wave of successful projects on ResearchKit, including apps that help people manage diabetes, heart disease and asthma.\n\n\n\nThere are also some examples of the problems Apple is facing as it tries to get more partners to adopt the tool. Earlier this month, a major player in the diabetes community said it would not be taking part in the app\u2019s data collection. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said in a statement that its members were not interested in the iPhone platform and \u201cwould prefer to conduct research studies using our own patient data that is gathered on an Android platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s likely an expensive prospect for the organization, given the popularity of iPhones in the United States. As of last year, Android devices accounted for just over half of all U.S. smartphone subscribers, while iOS devices made up around 41 percent. That\u2019s according to the Pew Research Center, which estimated last year that there were 121 million iPhone users in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe success of Apple\u2019s platform will hinge in part on how it handles data privacy and security concerns. Apple had to clear some hurdles in the early days of ResearchKit because many people were concerned about privacy when they heard it would rely on data from Apple\u2019s servers. Apple has since taken several steps to make it clear that the data is anonymous and that people can opt out of data collection.\n\n\n\nThe app program could also be a major part of the iPhone\u2019s future if it takes off. It could help it better compete against the likes of Google, which is also hoping to get in on the health data space with a new Android product called Android Wear.\n\n\n\nThe first public version of ResearchKit will be unveiled on Wednesday, the panel will also include representatives from Mount Sinai and Pfizer.\n\n\n\nThat event will be at 11:30 a.m. EDT in New York City, and it will be livestreamed on Fortune\u2019s website.]" time="1.542"><properties><property name="score" value="0.4640413721402486" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[\n\nSend this thread via email by filling out the fields below\n\n\n\nThread: Lost 10lbs in the last 3 weeks Send To:\n\nUse semi-colon to separate multiple addresses Your Name: Your Email: Add a personal message: Send this thread via email by filling out the fields below\n\n\n\n]" time="0.200"><properties><property name="score" value="0.8082296252250671" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[I don't think it is your attitude.

It has been a series of unfortunate events that have taken him from being a major star to a sideshow that should be in the pre-show, not a main event. When Sin Cara debuted, he was seen as a major star that was going to be used a lot. It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe problem was that he never delivered.\n\nHe was so unimpressive that he was booted from WWE in 2016. He is making an appearance at WrestleMania 33. For his sake, it would be best if he kept quiet and didn't interact with the crowd.\n\n9 Kelly Kelly\n\nvia tumblr.com\n\nKelly Kelly was a fan favorite during her time in WWE. She made her debut as a popular model who was wrestling on ECW. From there, she rose to the top as a valuable part of the roster. Kelly became a popular figure who had her own dedicated fans. She had the right amount of talent to be a decent worker, but it was her good looks that gave her the extra push.\n\nAfter leaving WWE in 2012, Kelly kept wrestling. She is back on the roster with TNA, but she has not appeared on a television episode of Impact Wrestling since December of 2015.\n\n8 Alberto Del Rio\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is a sad truth that Alberto Del Rio has fallen from his former position in the industry. He was a very big part of WWE. He was not only the United States Champion, but also a World Champion. Alberto had a unique presence as a superstar that could do things no one else could do. He also had the microphone skills to back up his moves.\n\nHis tenure in WWE was marred with incidents that made it clear he was not going to be there much longer. His time in Lucha Underground was more memorable, but it was a step down from what he used to be.\n\n7 The Great Khali\n\nvia cagesideseats.com\n\nThe Great Khali is not really a superstar that anyone really misses. His presence was laughable at times. The thing about Khali is that he had a lot of potential. He was very big and very strong, but he never seemed to have any clue about how to use those traits to his advantage.\n\nKhali is now an actor and a former wrestler. He is part of the reality show Khali Kisses, which involves him doing a lot of kisses on people.

Knox is not talked about much these days, but there was a time when people were curious about him.\n\nHe married the popular WWE superstar Kelly Kelly. The couple got married in 2014. It was a marriage that was not meant to last, as the couple divorced in 2016.\n\n5 Santino Marella\n\nvia ringsidenews.com\n\nSantino Marella will forever be a part of WWE. The WWE Hall of Fame is home to some great wrestlers and some very bad wrestlers. Santino is among those who have made an impression for one reason or another. His career with the company was not as successful as he had hoped, but he made a huge impact. He was the guy who was hilarious because he was so bad.\n\nSantino's last match was in 2014. He has done some backstage work, but the star has pretty much disappeared from WWE.\n\n4 Tyson Kidd\n\nvia heavy.com\n\nTyson Kidd was a true performer in WWE. He had a unique look, and he could really do it all. The man was skilled on the mic, in the ring, and he had a good personality. Everything came together for Tyson, but that would all change during an unfortunate injury. Tyson was a mid-carder who could have risen to a top level, but that was not meant to be.\n\nKidd is now recovering from his neck injury. He is still hoping to get into the ring again, but it is looking unlikely.\n\n3 Christian\n\nvia bodybuilding.com\n\nChristian is not a name that is being mentioned much these days. It is a shame, as he is one of the best performers of his time. Christian has made a career of being known for his impressive in-ring work and his ability to entertain fans. Christian was a popular superstar during his time in WWE and he did some good things for TNA.\n\nChristian has not been in the ring since December of 2015. He is trying to get back into the ring, but there is a possibility that his neck injury may have ended his career.\n\n2 Dolph Ziggler\n\nvia wrestlingnewssource.com\n\nDolph Ziggler had the chance to become a very big star in WWE. Unfortunately, things have not been going well for Ziggler. He was once a main eventer, but he has fallen to the bottom of the card. He is one of the many guys who will be pushed as the underdog who is going to have the moment of their life.\n\nZiggler has not been the focus of WWE. It is likely that he will be entering a new chapter of his career in the near future. The most likely place would be in Ring of Honor, but WWE has shown a lot of interest in Ziggler.\n\n1 Wade Barrett\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the casual fan to remember Wade Barrett. He had a short run in WWE, but he did his part as a mid-carder. Barrett is a former Intercontinental Champion. He did well in WWE as a member of The Nexus, but his star power never quite took off.\n\nBarrett has been out of WWE since 2014. He has had some ups and downs in the independent circuit, but his career has largely gone downhill. It is possible that he could get another chance with WWE. That would probably be the only way that fans would get to see him again.\n\nBarrett has been trying to make a name for himself in the business world. He launched a website last year.

Thank you for the continued support on the blog. So, how have you all been doing?\n\nToday, I have a special post. I know most of you do not know but it is the 'World Animal Day'. The day is celebrated worldwide on October 4 to create awareness of animal rights and welfare. The day is a very special one for me because I am a vegetarian, animal lover and a dog-person.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the last one year, I have been trying to spread the awareness among the people. I have been trying to encourage people to stop using animals as fur coats, cosmetics and for food. I want people to know the feelings of these animals, the pains they suffer and what they go through while they are alive. Also, the environmental damage they cause to the planet. It is very important to spread this message because animals are treated as if they are some sort of toys that we can play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, I would like to share with you some tips on how we can help the animals and make the planet a better place to live. I also have a small personal pledge to make. Also, if you have not signed the pledge yet, you can also make your own pledge to protect the animals and the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips and pledges to help the animals\n\n(made by my friend!)\n\nOne way we can make a change is by making an effort to not use cosmetics that are tested on animals. We can choose to use all cruelty free products and make a conscious effort not to use anything that has been tested on animals.\n\nWays to reduce our carbon footprints and help protect the environment:\n\nAvoid eating meat, or even better, go vegetarian (dairy, eggs are not vegan but I still encourage you to stop using dairy products as well)\n\nUse eco-friendly products - Not just cosmetics but also in our everyday lives.\n\nGo cruelty free - Choose cruelty free products and wear clothes that have not been made out of leather, fur or wool.\n\nStop buying those animals that we do not need. Also, choose to buy second hand or recycled clothes. Avoid buying pets if you cannot provide the proper care for them.\n\nAdopt, don't buy! You can adopt a dog or cat from an animal shelter. Do not buy animals from pet stores or breeders. They are sold to you as &quot;breed-free&quot; animals but most of them have been bred in horrible conditions. Also, make sure you know the sex of the animal you are getting, because they usually are sold as 'un-neutered' or 'un-spayed' animals.\n\nMake a conscious effort to not use plastic bags. Use reusable bags or better still, try to avoid using bags at all.\n\nTry to use products that do not harm the environment and are biodegradable.\n\nWays to help the animals:\n\nSign the pledge - To show that you support the cause to protect the animals.\n\nShare the post - Let others know of the cruelty that the animals go through. Let them know how they can help the animals too.\n\nJoin or start a protest or campaign to help the animals.\n\nThe small pledge I am making is to help the animals. Every month, I will be donating some money to an animal shelter in my town to help feed the dogs and cats there.\n\nThese are just some of the ways we can help the animals and the planet. We can all make a change, and make this planet a better place to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know how to become a vegan, and which cosmetics are tested on animals, you can read this post: How to be a vegan?\n\nRemember, we are what we eat, so be what you want to be. Be a good person, who loves animals and helps to save the planet.\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nPriya]" time="1.964"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9960466921329498" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Top Customer Reviews\n\nWhere reviews refer to foods or cosmetic products, results may vary from person to person.

Roots can become entangled in the small cracks between the asphalt and the cement to create the impression that the tree is growing out of the road! And when the roots do become entwined, the pressure can be so great that the roots are destroyed. We all know the danger this creates for the trees.\n\nThe solution to this problem is obvious: pave over the whole road surface. Not so fast! In the City of Chicago, for example, there is a practice that preserves the utility of the tree\u2019s roots and of the road surface itself. The practice is called \u201cmilling\u201d. Milling involves cutting the asphalt out in a shape that will not disturb the roots and adding back in a new surface. While the tree is protected, the roots are not disturbed and the road surface is left intact. When a tree is scheduled for removal, this is often the method of choice. Milling also involves improving the root zone around the tree. The roots of many trees can\u2019t penetrate the compacted soil that is found beneath pavement, so it is necessary to mill the area to promote root growth.\n\nMilling is less expensive than paving over a road surface and can also be less expensive than removal of a tree. Milling should be done whenever possible and certainly before a tree is scheduled for removal.

For some, the reason is because they still have some of their shopping list to complete. Others, however, have an entirely different reason.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian adult will spend $473.12 on gifts this holiday season. That means the average consumer will spend almost $35 more this year than last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of consumers have gone overboard,\u201d says Ted Michalos, founder of CMG Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the spending that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s what they\u2019re spending the money on.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because many shoppers are buying gifts for themselves. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re spending on the latest fashions, but rather toys and electronics. And the majority of these gifts, at 41.8 per cent, are going to be purchased online.\n\nHowever, the reason why so many people are spending online is because they\u2019re trying to avoid the crowds and waiting in lines.\n\n\u201cSome consumers just get too stressed and they go online to get their stuff,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd if they do that, they\u2019re likely going to be paying more for the gifts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because while there are fewer people at the store, they\u2019re paying more per person. For example, if someone is paying $50 for a gift in the store, they\u2019re likely to pay more than $50 online.\n\n\u201cThis is really the time where you\u2019re going to have to do your best to have everything done by the 15th,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd it\u2019s definitely a good idea to sit down with your spouse or significant other and look at your budget. And when you have a child, the best thing to do is to write down what you\u2019re going to spend. That\u2019s a real good thing to do, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll overspend.\u201d\n\nAnd that could come with consequences, because if you\u2019re overspending, you could be limiting your ability to spend on your children or other family members in the future.\n\n\u201cYou can go overboard and give away everything you have to your kids and that could be a problem,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cThis could be an opportunity to teach your kids about moderation, and also the difference between \u2018I want\u2019 and \u2018I need.\u2019\u201d\n\nBecause with Christmas, most people are shopping with the mindset of \u2018I want,\u2019 not \u2018I need.\u2019 And that can be a problem, because it will prevent you from saving or investing.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be shopping on a credit card, you\u2019re going to be in big trouble,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cIf you\u2019re not able to pay off that debt by the end of January, you\u2019re going to be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nWant to know more about debt?

'I'd do ya if I could' and then the photo request. You should probably just block him and be done with it. 'Doing ya' or not,&quot; one person said.\n\nAnother person had an idea on how to deal with it, tweeting, &quot;You know what? Be a bigger person, send it to him. For posterity.&quot;\n\nMany others were in complete agreement with this sentiment.\n\n&quot;I don't know this man and I probably never will. But I 100% understand why he's going to be blocked.

But it's not ok. It's not ok for you to message someone for a photo. It's not ok for you to say 'I'd do you' and it's not ok for you to try and justify your actions,&quot; one person said.\n\nAnother pointed out that he was trying to pressure her into sending him the photo, and wasn't taking responsibility for his actions.\n\n&quot;He's a creep, and still wants to force you to send him a picture of your body. He'll delete the tweet if you do, otherwise you can block him. This is on him, not you. You have no responsibility to 'meet' him,&quot; another person said.\n\n&quot;Ok let's stop there with the 'I would've taken a photo with you anyways' thing. That's not what this is about. This is about someone sending unsolicited nudes,&quot; another person pointed out.\n\nIn response, @kendtee wrote that she wasn't bothered, because at the end of the day she was a &quot;pretty woman who didn't need to be respected&quot;.\n\n&quot;I didn't get mad or freak out or feel the need to drag his name through the mud. I just calmly informed him that I have a man in my life and that I'm flattered but I don't share photos like that and I'm taken.

At the time of this writing, there are two options: SharePointContext and SPUtility. Both work fine, and I think it\u2019s really up to your personal preference and comfort level to choose either. But for my purposes, I\u2019m a fan of using SharePointContext because it will use the most current context available, which is what I like to do.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the two SharePoint context providers that we have at our disposal: SharePointContext and SPUtility. We\u2019ll use these in conjunction with the new SharePoint REST API to get a SharePoint context.\n\nSharePointContext\n\nThe SharePointContext class represents a SharePoint context. The context is the central part of the SharePoint client object model, and it\u2019s available from any client, including SharePoint-hosted, remote, or SharePoint-hosted-remote applications.\n\nTo create a SharePointContext object, you call the SharePointContext.GetContextAsync() method and pass in a SharePointContextOptions object. The SharePointContextOptions object provides the user information and authentication settings. We\u2019ll dive into the details in the \u201cAuthorization\u201d section of this article.\n\nOnce you have your context, you can then call methods on it. The context has a number of methods on it to retrieve different information.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the available methods:\n\nGetContextAsync() - The method that is used to create the context.\n\n\n\n- The method that is used to create the context. SharePointContextPermission - The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user. SharePointPermissions - The property that contains the current permission level of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current permission level of the user. ListPermissions - The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists. SPHostUrl - The property that contains the URL of the current host application.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the URL of the current host application. Site - The property that contains the current site of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current site of the user. UserPrincipalName - The property that contains the username of the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the username of the current user. Web - The property that contains the current web of the user.\n\n\n\nSPUtility\n\nThe SPUtility class provides static methods to retrieve a SharePoint context and return it. To get the context, you call the SPUtility.GetSharePointContext() method.\n\nThe methods you have available on the SPUtility.SharePointContext object are:\n\nClientContext\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\nGetClientContext()\n\n\n\nGetWeb()\n\n\n\nSharePointContext Permission\n\nBefore we dive into the SharePoint context, let\u2019s talk about permission. The SharePoint context is going to be pretty useless without a permission token. We\u2019re going to talk about this permission token a lot in this article, so let\u2019s just take a quick look at how it\u2019s generated.\n\nWe\u2019ll need to use the SharePoint permissions provider to generate the token. To do so, you\u2019ll need to call the SharePointPermissionManager.GetPermissionsAsync() method. You\u2019ll need to pass in an instance of the site where you want the permissions for.\n\nIn this example, we\u2019re going to call GetPermissionsAsync() and get the current user\u2019s permissions.\n\nGetPermissionsAsync() returns a SharePointPermissions object, which you can use to set your permissions on lists, folders, and documents. The SharePoint permissions are applied in a single pass. This means that you can\u2019t apply different permissions to different entities. For example, if you want to apply permissions on the web, the site, and the lists and folders, you\u2019ll need to pass in the permission on the web, then on the site, then on the lists and folders. You can, however, pass in different permissions to different lists and folders.\n\nOne other thing to note about SharePoint permissions is that they only grant access to the web, not to the list or to the folder itself.\n\nFor example, if a user doesn\u2019t have the Edit permission to a list, he will still be able to view it. But if the user has the Edit permission to the list, he will be able to edit it.\n\nIf you want to deny access to the whole list, you can set the permissions for the list and all its subfolders to Deny.\n\nIn order to create the context, we\u2019ll use the context, the SharePoint permissions provider, and a helper class, which we\u2019ll talk about later in the article. The full example is shown in Listing 1.\n\nThe context object will now be passed to the constructor of a class called FileRootsProvider. The FileRootsProvider class is part of a helper class that I wrote and will be available to you in this article.\n\nThe provider will be created with the context and then called to generate the access token. Once the access token is generated, it will be returned to us, and we can start to retrieve information about the site and its lists and folders.\n\nAccess Token\n\nWhen you call the SharePoint permissions provider, you\u2019ll receive a token that represents the permissions for the current user. The token is returned as a SharePointPermissions object, which is what we\u2019ll use to apply the permissions.\n\nTo create a SharePointPermissions object, you need to pass in the site URL where the permissions should apply. For our example, we\u2019ll pass in the site URL to the SharePointPermissions constructor.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve created the permissions, you can apply them to the lists and folders. You can do this by passing in an instance of a list or folder to the SharePointPermissions constructor. If you want to apply permissions to all lists and folders, you can simply pass in an empty list or folder.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve created the permissions, we can use the FileRootsProvider class to generate the access token. The access token is returned as a SharePointContextPermissions object. The SharePointContextPermissions object contains the permission token and other details that we\u2019ll use to get information from the SharePoint site.\n\nAs you can see, the code to get the access token is pretty straightforward. The example is shown in Listing 2.\n\nList\n\nGetting the access token isn\u2019t all you need to do. You also need to be able to get a list and get a list item. To do this, you\u2019ll need to call the SharePointContext.GetListAsync() method. The method is easy to use and returns a list object.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a specific list, you can pass in the list GUID or the URL of the list. Listing 3 shows an example of both the URL and GUID to get the lists from.\n\nItems\n\nThe code to get an item from a list is just as easy as getting the list. You can pass in the list item GUID to the GetListItemAsync() method. Listing 4 shows an example of how to get the list item with the GUID.\n\nSummary\n\nThis article was a quick look at how to get a SharePoint context. The examples used a helper class that I created to make it a little easier to get access to lists and items from SharePoint.]" time="4.002"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997959392411369" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[A few months back, I wrote an article about the journey from yearning to prayer.

There is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. This paper exploits the introduction of minimum attainment targets in the National Curriculum for schools to explore the impact of early education policies on students\u2019 achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nData and methods\n\nAnalysis\n\nDiscussion\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nUniversity participation in the UK has grown substantially since the early 1990s. There are now 1.4 million undergraduates, which is almost double the number in 1992. However, participation rates have remained relatively low among those from lower socioeconomic groups (Furlong and Millar, 2008). For example, 40 per cent of young adults from high-income backgrounds were participating in higher education in 2011-12, compared to 21 per cent from the poorest fifth of families.\n\nTo some extent, low participation among young people from less advantaged backgrounds is to be expected given the historical association of university education with privileged groups. Participation rates increased significantly in the 1960s, after state support for university was extended to less affluent groups. Participation rose further during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, but then stagnated in the 1990s and declined slightly after 2002. Only in the past decade has participation among the less well-off again risen to the levels recorded in the early 1990s (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. University participation rates by parental income, 1962-2012\n\nNote: Figures are cohort entry rates for those who went to university in each year. Sources: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2014); Sutton Trust/Ipsos Mori (2012); Education Policy Institute (2013).\n\nDespite increased participation, the gap in participation rates between young people from more and less advantaged backgrounds is still large, even after controlling for qualifications. On average, young people from the most advantaged fifth of families are about twice as likely to go to university as those from the least advantaged fifth (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Proportion of young people who go to university by family income, 1996-2012\n\nSource: Participation rates (log scale) are from the UCAS End of Cycle Reports, 1996-2012. The relative income quintiles are from the Family Resources Survey, 2008-2012. The quintiles have been adjusted to allow for comparison across years by using a fixed poverty line.\n\nAt a recent seminar organised by the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy, Professor Martin Brown (2012) suggested that it is \u2018a great mystery why this gap is not widening even more\u2019. He also pointed out that there is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. It is well-known that, in addition to their socio-economic background, non-cognitive skills, such as motivation, are important predictors of academic achievement. Since the increase in university participation has been driven by the growth in participation of less advantaged groups, it is not surprising that it has also been associated with a fall in the average grades of university entrants.\n\nThis paper is motivated by this observation, that early education policies have played an important role in the increase in participation among less advantaged groups. We focus on two such policies: the requirement to meet minimum attainment targets in English, mathematics and science, and the national literacy and numeracy strategies. We explore the impact of these policies on students\u2019 achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees. We also find that the increase in the A-level scores and the higher participation rate associated with the introduction of minimum attainment targets cannot be explained by the improvement in the overall level of academic performance in schools or by the lower socioeconomic status of those schools that introduced minimum attainment targets.\n\nData and methods\n\nTo analyse the impact of minimum attainment targets, we use the school-level dataset that the Department for Education makes available annually for the National Pupil Database (NPD). The NPD contains rich information about individual pupils and their schools. We first use the NPD to examine the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education by using cohort-level information on final examinations. We then explore the impact of minimum attainment targets using changes in the composition of achievement. The results we present in this paper are robust to the alternative methods of analysis of achievement levels and changes in the composition of achievement.\n\nIn the first stage of our analysis, we explore the evolution of the A-level examination results by using the cohort-level information on final examinations. To study the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education, we use the data on A-level grades in GCSE and A-level examinations from 1996 to 2012. In this period, the examinations have changed significantly, from the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and the A-level examinations. The A-level examination was first introduced in the early 1950s as an academically rigorous alternative to the less selective B-level examinations (Wynne, 2010). Until 1988, A-level grades (i.e. O/A levels) were assigned by teachers, not by the students. From 1988, the responsibility for grading moved to schools. The examination was revised in the early 1990s, after which it was separated into two components: A-level and AS-level. The A-level examinations were re-structured in 2000. Most importantly, the exams have become linear rather than modular. The exams in each subject are now taken at the end of the two-year course. The exams are now externally assessed, and the grade is assigned according to the nationally defined A-level grade boundaries. The percentage of the cohort that sat the A-level examinations increased from about two-thirds in the early 1990s to more than 90 per cent in the mid-2000s. This reflects a policy shift in the assessment of vocational qualifications, which reduced the proportion of vocational qualifications that counted towards a student\u2019s A-level grade.\n\nWe use a slightly modified version of the grading system developed by Hayward, Parry and Stewart (2009) and Bias et al. (2011). We use a scale of 5 grades to assess the performance of students in different subjects: 5 is an \u2018A*\u2019 grade, 4 is an \u2018A\u2019 grade, 3 is a \u2018B\u2019 grade, 2 is a \u2018C\u2019 grade and 1 is a \u2018D\u2019 grade. The best possible grade in each subject is an \u2018A*\u2019. This grading system differs from the one used in most of the existing analyses of A-level results, which use an A-E grading system. The difference between the two grading systems is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that about 60 per cent of the students in the upper grade boundary of \u2018A*\u2019 under the old system would be below the upper boundary of \u2018A*\u2019 under the new system. Similarly, about 45 per cent of the students in the lower boundary of \u2018C\u2019 would be in the upper boundary of \u2018C\u2019 under the old system, and about 25 per cent of students in the lower boundary of \u2018C\u2019 would be in the upper boundary of \u2018C\u2019 under the new system. We expect that the increase in the A-level scores associated with the change in the grading system will be smaller for subjects that were not directly affected by the reform, such as English, maths and science. We do not analyse students\u2019 performance in the core and non-core subjects, because data on the subject of A-level examination was not available for every pupil.\n\nFigure 3. Grading scales of GCSE and A-level examinations\n\nIn Figure 4, we present the cumulative distribution of A-level scores for each cohort, by the subject studied. Figure 5 shows that the average A-level score increased from a little less than \u2018C\u2019 in 1996 to more than \u2018C\u2019 in 2012, which is consistent with the improvement in the average GCSE results. The gap in the average grades between different subjects remained stable. The increase in the average A-level grades was particularly large in science subjects and in humanities subjects. We do not find evidence of a widening gap in A-level scores between the richest and the poorest students. In the humanities subjects, there is some evidence of an increase in the A-level scores of the less well-off. However, the increase in the average A-level scores was so large that the difference in the average scores between the richest and the poorest students decreased even though it was not eliminated.\n\nFigure 4.

When George Henry Alcock (1864\u20131941), a climber and mountaineer, visited the Cuillin in 1893, he wrote in his book Through the Highlands and Islands of Scotland:\n\nNo one who had not seen the Black Cuillin and the peculiar forms which the rocks assume would believe that nature could assume such strange shapes as are seen here. The first view of the Cuillin from the south makes them look like a huge fortress of rock, with fantastic turrets and chimneys, and battlemented walls.\n\n\nToday these classic features, viewed from the slopes of the nearby mountains of the mainland, such as the Beinn Eighe and M\xf2ine Mh\xf2r, have hardly changed. But the Cuillin are not just aesthetically pleasing. To their first British explorers in the mid-nineteenth century, the Black Cuillin, which form a massive ridge running from Coire an Lochain in Glen Brittle to An Dubh Sgeir, seemed a forbidding mountain barrier, \u2018a fortress of rock\u2019. Their modern reputation, and that of the smaller range of the Red Cuillin to the south-east, as a major challenge to both rock climbers and mountaineers, was established during the second half of the twentieth century. However, despite the presence of the two main ridges on the Black Cuillin (North-West Ridge and Central Ridge), many individual peaks, and the climbing routes up them, were relatively unexplored. This was to change in the 1970s and 1980s when many of the hard, mixed and winter routes, most of which were first climbed in the Cuillin, were recorded by enthusiastic pioneers. Today, climbing and scrambling in the Cuillin can be combined with hillwalking, and the varied routes, combined with the varied weather of Skye, offer an extremely satisfying and testing experience for a mountaineer.\n\nIn writing this guidebook, I have had to make many decisions regarding what routes to describe, and which to omit. Many climbers may not agree with my choices, and it is inevitable that a guidebook such as this will not be comprehensive. As well as describing my chosen routes, I have tried to include a range of other interesting aspects of the Cuillin, in order to make the book relevant to anyone interested in a mountaineering trip to Skye.\n\nGeology\n\nThe geology of Skye, and especially the Cuillin, is fascinating, and as well as a number of peaks and ridges, it has given rise to a series of dramatic glens, the upper parts of which are in the Inaccessible Pinnacle (Coire nam Bian) to the north of the main ridge. The Black Cuillin consist of metamorphic rocks which were formed as a result of a major mountain-building event in the Caledonian Orogeny, the mountain-building event which took place between 500 and 400 million years ago. At this time, a number of folds (anticlines and synclines) were formed, some of which can be seen today. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr, for example, was the result of the raising up of a syncline (Fig. 1). This event also resulted in the granite being exposed to the surface, but this did not happen everywhere. To the east of the island, most of Skye is underlain by metamorphic rocks, but to the west, particularly on the western coast of the Trotternish peninsula, granite is exposed. The Blue Stack is also part of a major fold which has resulted in the formation of the Trotternish Ridge.\n\nFigure 1. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr.\n\n\nThese major events have also resulted in a relatively complex geological map, with three main rock types (Fig. 2). A general layer of granite, called the Inaccessible Pinnacle Quartz Diorite, extends from the Blue Stack north-eastwards to Beinn Eighe. This granite has been intruded by the Red Cuillin Granite, which has a different composition and thus has different characteristics to the underlying rock. In the central and eastern parts of the main ridge of the Black Cuillin, the rocks are composed of the Papcastle Gneiss, which is a granitic metamorphic rock. However, to the west, around Sgurr nan Gillean and Glas Bheinn, the Papcastle Gneiss has been intruded by the Kintail Granite, giving rise to a more mottled appearance in this part of the Cuillin. A further complex of rocks is exposed on the north side of Glen Brittle, which includes the Torridonian Sandstone, Lewisian Gneiss, and Dalradian schists.\n\nFigure 2. Geology of Skye showing the main rock types.\n\n\nPeaks\n\nAs well as providing interest to geologists, the geomorphology of the Cuillin is also fascinating for climbers and walkers. With so many ridges and peaks, there is much to explore, and each summit offers its own rewards. Some of the individual peaks are not very high, but offer serious scrambles and rock climbs, while others, such as the highest summit of Sgurr nan Gillean (1,018 m) and the first major peak on the Central Cuillin Ridge, Sgurr Dearg (974 m), offer impressive views.

The sky has always been full of questions. Our ability to dream big and speculate has enabled us to discover, theorize, and theorize even more. But where do we get the answers? These are the top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n10. Extraterrestrial Origin\n\nThe human race began to emerge from the Stone Age. The caves and forests were just getting familiar with the new inhabitants. There was a long time of fear and ignorance. Before we started to understand the world, they began to imagine what is outside the world. Some thought of creatures so powerful that they could destroy the world. Other speculated that we are a higher level of evolution and are the result of genetic experimentation of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nLater, these speculations were transformed into mythology and the imagination of the humans. In our modern world, it has turned into science. Many scientists still believe that we are not the only life in the universe and that at some point in history there was a connection with extraterrestrials. Some of them even believe that the first stages of our life were carried out with the help of aliens.\n\n9. Time Travel\n\nSince the beginning of history, people have always been fascinated with time. To travel back in time would allow us to explore the unknown, but would it be worth it? We live in a world where time is constant. Change is one of the most important principles of human life.\n\nNevertheless, many scientists still consider the possibility of time travel. The hypothetical method would be to build a giant machine that would make a hole in time. But how can this happen? It would involve breaking the speed of light and space.\n\nThe machine would have to be so big that it would create a massive black hole. Then the time machine would be moved into the center of the black hole, which would allow it to break the laws of time. So far, scientists have not been able to prove the validity of this theory.\n\n8. Time Travelers\n\nDespite the fact that time travel is still a hypothesis, there are people who believe that it is not. They claim to have traveled back in time to the present or to a previous generation. For this reason, there are also numerous stories about people who claim to have returned from the future to save the world.\n\nMost people who claim to have traveled back in time are just crazy. However, many scientists consider it possible that in the future, when we understand the laws of physics better, we may be able to travel through time. This possibility has been a mystery for a long time. So, this is a list of top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n7. Deja Vu\n\nThe theory of Deja Vu is so controversial that many scientists do not even dare to think about it. The definition of deja vu is, when a person experiences something, although he has never done it before. Many people think of it as a kind of visual hallucination. The most popular theory about the phenomenon is that it is a past memory that has not been triggered by the usual way.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the brain creates a fake memory to deceive the person who feels it. The theory is that in reality the person does not experience a deja vu, but it is an internal response to the same scenario. In short, the brain recognizes the environment and recognizes the story that it represents.\n\nIn this case, the illusion is that the person has lived through this scenario. Nevertheless, there are many people who do not think so. The reason is that deja vu is a phenomenon that occurs in any person. So, we have 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n6. Water World\n\nIt is one of the most popular theories in the world of science. It is believed that the moon is a result of a collision between the Earth and a body much larger than it. As a result of the collision, our planet was literally ripped. But what happened to the mass that fell on the surface? According to scientists, this part of the Earth remained liquid.\n\nThe evidence is so compelling that the theory of the water world has become a reality. For example, there is a large number of scientists who believe that the moon was the result of the Earth\u2019s rotation and gravitational collapse.\n\nMoreover, there are evidences that this theory may be true. For example, when scientists tried to drill in the Antarctic, they found water underneath. Also, according to many scientists, the planet Mercury, which has no magnetic field, may be the result of the remains of the water world.\n\n5]" time="2.430"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997625708580017" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[There are no spoilers in this review\n\nFrom the off, the third episode in the new Star Trek Discovery series has a slow pace. It is the most quiet of the three episodes and is more of a character study in the struggles faced by all of the Discovery crew and how that manifests in different ways. With that in mind, I find it strange that this is not getting the universal praise that the first two episodes were. But that\u2019s the power of spoilers I suppose, no one knew what was coming in the first two episodes.\n\nThe episode itself, despite being more quiet than the first two, still manages to deliver plenty of story. You do have to take it with a grain of salt because some of the \u2018bad guy\u2019 stuff is almost unbelievably naive but that\u2019s the Star Trek universe for you. Despite the low stakes, I was still hooked on every word and scene.\n\nThere are plenty of hints that we can be certain that there is a big bad out there that we have not seen yet. Perhaps that is what made the episode more interesting. There is something looming over them and we don\u2019t know what it is yet.\n\nFor some reason, people seem to have a problem with the fact that the crew spend time getting to know one another, with only a couple of scenes of violence and action. Personally, I found that the social dynamics between the characters to be very interesting and engaging. Yes, this is probably true to life and does have some real life parallels. I am glad they did not waste time with all of that mindless action that I\u2019ve become so accustomed to.\n\nThere are no huge shocks in this episode and the pay offs to the mini story arcs were a bit weak. But when the pay off came, I was still glad that they took the time to introduce us to the characters in this way.\n\nIf you have been put off watching Star Trek Discovery because of the fear of spoilers, then I would suggest you don\u2019t worry too much and go ahead and start the show. If you can manage to resist the temptation of the spoilers for the next two weeks, then I think you will be very happy with the third episode and the direction the show is heading in.\n\nLet us know what you thought of the episode in the comments below and if you have seen the first two episodes.]" time="1.200"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9963693420092264" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Price includes 15% HST, 10% goes to the developer (Living Balance)\n\nWaterfront construction, 11 homes, classic tudor style, quality &amp; contemporary style homes to suit all tastes.

This book is called \u201cReady Player One\u201d by Ernest Cline. I can\u2019t recommend this book enough. So what\u2019s the big deal? You are about to find out.\n\nSo what is it about?\n\nThis book is a story about Wade, a teenager, living in the year 2045. The world is in a bad state.\n\nTechnology has progressed very fast, but a lot of humans have been left behind. Wade\u2019s life sucks. He lives with his aunt in the slums of Oklahoma. All he does is play video games.\n\nThen, one day, he hears of a contest to win a fortune by finding the first Easter egg in the virtual reality game OASIS. The creator of OASIS has died and has left behind a secret quest. A quest that has the prize to the first person to complete the quest. But there is a catch: only the creator of the game knows how to find the Easter egg. And he has hidden the clues in the game.\n\nIt is up to Wade to try to find the Easter egg first. But not alone. He quickly assembles a group of fellow OASIS players. This group consists of his best friends and fellow gamers. This quest will soon turn into a journey. And I don\u2019t want to tell you more, because I don\u2019t want to spoil the story for you.\n\nA bit about the Author:\n\nErnest Cline is the author of the book Ready Player One. He is from the state of Texas. He has lived in New York City for a few years, but has now moved back to Texas. He is 40 years old and has been writing books for a long time. His first book was published in 2001.\n\nErnest Cline is very much into old science fiction books, and especially the 1980\u2019s. He loves the music, TV shows, video games and movies of that decade.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nWhen I read this book, I really couldn\u2019t put it down. I just wanted to know how the story would end. I wanted to know if the good guys would win. I wanted to know how they would beat the bad guys.\n\nI am sure you will love this book, just like I did. It is filled with great references to the 1980\u2019s. If you are born after that time, you will probably have to read the story first to get the references, but I am sure you will enjoy it.\n\nI will also tell you, that this book is a great story, and I can easily recommend this book to any reader. It is not just a story about technology. It is also a story about friendship and courage. And in the end it is a story about hope and dream.\n\nIf you want to read this book, you can find it on Amazon. Or your favorite bookstore. I am not going to tell you how much it costs.

And people did not like that. I remember having this conversation where somebody said to me, \u2018When you are perceived as yourself, people have a hard time relating to that.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I think you are misperceiving yourself to be someone who has a choice.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying this like, \u2018Hey, world, my message is this, and you\u2019re going to like it.\u2019 That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about the moment in which you are caught off guard, and you\u2019re on tour and you\u2019re not doing what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, but you\u2019re still getting a check.&quot;\n\nOn The Benefits Of Ghostwriting:\n\n&quot;I don\u2019t have any beef with the world.

But I would never want to turn my back on being a guitar player and a songwriter. And the reason why is because I have a fan base that loves me for being a guitar player and a songwriter, and it\u2019s very separate from the people who like my pop songs.&quot;\n\nHis Concert Review Regrets:\n\n&quot;I was like, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to be under these bright lights, and it\u2019s going to be this one moment in time where we\u2019re going to play it for you. And we want to give you the most you can get for your dollar.\u2019 And then I think I had a bad couple of years. And I lost myself and tried to get myself back, and now I\u2019m playing shows where, like, I\u2019m not having a good time.&quot;\n\nOn Live Music Criticism:\n\n&quot;I think we\u2019re overintellectualizing music. The discussion about music is so myopic and minuscule. \u2018He did this, and it\u2019s a disservice to this particular song.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, well, maybe you don\u2019t like this song. If you don\u2019t like it, just don\u2019t buy it. But that\u2019s not the way it works anymore. So I think we\u2019ve been eating the meat and spitting out the bones.

The report notes that the three largest state owned electricity distribution companies (including ElectraNet and SA Power Networks) have all seen rapid increases in their distribution costs since 2013.\n\nThe report recommends that the South Australian Government take action to:\n\nUndertake an urgent review of electricity retail regulation\n\nUndertake an urgent review of the existing regulation of distribution charges\n\nExamine mechanisms to enable local distribution networks to invest in assets that improve reliability for customers, and facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the network\n\nThe report also recommends that the Australian Energy Regulator should seek to work with industry to seek additional reforms to be considered by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC).\n\nThe report is open for submissions and can be found here.\n\nMore information on how energy networks operate and cost can be found here.\n\nSee our website for further information on energy and power regulation.]" time="1.046"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9114988644917806" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[A special thanks to all the people who have read this story and have offered me constructive criticism.\n\nA Big Thanks to The Prankster and Sage, also to Herr and themuseforlove for providing such helpful and encouraging critiques.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nHis life had been pretty good lately.

After 22 h, glucose was depleted and glucose uptake and acetate production were completely ceased in pure B. fibrisolvens cultures.

But just like the Browns have a way of winning the games they're supposed to, Fitzpatrick has a way of having performances like he did against the Browns last year.\n\nIt just happens in reverse.\n\nThe defense was ranked 30th in the league in pass defense and would give up more yards in the first quarter than in the entire game the year before, yet it's Fitzpatrick who throws for 5,367 yards and 40 touchdowns that year. That's not a typo. And it's not because he was the quarterback of the future and Josh Gordon was the No. 1 receiver of the future, either. (We'll ignore the fact that the Browns traded for Jason Campbell at the end of the season to play quarterback and traded away Trent Richardson for basically nothing.)\n\nFitzpatrick and the Browns were matched up against each other in the third week of the 2012 season, and by that point in the season Fitzpatrick had thrown for 4,008 yards and 27 touchdowns in just 12 games. He finished the season with an astronomical 8.18 yards per attempt, which was the highest in NFL history. (Since 2001, at least.) He averaged two touchdowns per game for the first three weeks of that season before throwing just five more in the final nine games.\n\nAnd that was in his first season with the Bucs. They acquired him on the last day of August, after he'd spent the last few months being cut and re-signed by the Bills, which was the latest example of the Bills treating him like a starting quarterback without actually starting him. When the Bucs traded for him, it was widely considered a sign that they'd be moving on from Josh Freeman, but Fitzpatrick's job was only to hold the fort. He didn't even start his first game until the Bucs' eighth game of the season.\n\nThis time around, Fitzpatrick is more than holding the fort. The Bucs have put him on the short list of best quarterbacks in the NFL, with his name appearing on every single MVP ballot last year, and after a few years of analysts treating him like a highly replaceable backup, he has emerged as a bonafide starter. And like most No. 1 quarterbacks, he also seems to thrive against certain teams.\n\nIt seems like a good rule of thumb to get out of the way when he's playing his best.\n\nThe Bucs will almost definitely start out slow against the Browns on Sunday, but they're not going to go through another slow start and blow a lead against the Browns for a second time. It just won't happen.\n\nThis is a different year, a different Browns team, and a different quarterback. It's also a different Ryan Fitzpatrick.]" time="1.481"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9998149275779724" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nSunderland AFC striker Steven Fletcher has had his \xa320,000 Bentley vandalised and stolen, sparking a massive police hunt.\n\nThe \xa345,000 luxury motor, which was parked up outside his home, was spotted being driven away by an offender, believed to be male, wearing a black crash helmet and driving a silver Ford Mondeo.\n\nPolice say it was not a random attack and is being treated as a targeted theft.\n\nThe car has the registration number CN55 ANT and Sunderland AFC can confirm the vehicle belongs to Fletcher.\n\nThe vehicle is a black Bentley Continental GT Speed with blacked out windows.\n\nA spokeswoman for Northumbria Police said: \u201cWe received a report of a car theft in Sunderland on Monday night.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle was parked outside a house and was seen being driven away by a man, who was wearing a black crash helmet.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle was a Bentley Continental GT Speed with blacked out windows.\n\n\u201cThe car had the registration number CN55 ANT.\n\n\u201cThis was not a random incident.

These ducks, according to the World Health Organization, most likely caught the virus from chickens, because H5N1-V has not previously been detected in wild birds, and H5N1 has not previously been found circulating among wild birds anywhere in the world. The two ducks apparently had not recently come into contact with any chickens. The H5N1-V strain found in the ducks is one of at least 14 genetically distinct H5N1 subtypes. While the H5N1-V strain can infect chickens, it cannot efficiently spread among them or to other species.\n\nH5N1 is an avian influenza virus, meaning that it naturally infects birds. Over the past 14 years, H5N1 has caused at least 555 infections and 282 deaths in humans. While those numbers are higher than any other human infection since influenza was first identified in humans in 1918, they are still a small fraction of the estimated 5 billion to 8 billion birds that have been infected with H5N1 over the past decade. The World Health Organization says that \u201cit is difficult to estimate accurately the number of cases that have gone undetected.\u201d Since the virus has spread to so many different countries, it is likely that many cases have gone undetected. Nevertheless, the case-fatality rate (defined as the percentage of people who die from a given disease) from H5N1 in humans is estimated at 60 percent. It is difficult to compare H5N1\u2019s case-fatality rate to those of other viruses. The case-fatality rate from the H1N1 influenza virus that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide, was only 2.5 percent, yet that virus killed about 2 percent of the world\u2019s population.\n\nGiven the high death toll, it is important to find the best ways to limit the spread of H5N]" time="1.276"><properties><property name="score" value="0.8305776715278625" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[As word spread of the new church\u2019s intentions, many Muslims came to have a look. \u201cThey were surprised to see Christians.\u201d\n\nKoberg said he was surprised to see the modest construction was built as quickly as it was.\n\n\u201cWe have enough of everything we need.

What's more, the recent natural gas pipeline explosion in California, which prompted a moratorium on new development, will exacerbate the problem.\n\nOver the next five years, the United States will have to import nearly half of the energy it uses, according to the most recent forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. As of now, the United States is the largest energy importer in the world, importing more energy than any other country. We import 3.5 million barrels of oil per day, and more than 80 percent of our oil comes from foreign countries. This puts us at the mercy of OPEC nations, and increasingly Russia, who we are now trying to court to invest in our own energy infrastructure.\n\nThis dependence is a matter of great concern for many energy analysts. Some say that it's time to cut our losses and invest in the most energy-efficient technology possible while we still can.\n\nOur continued dependence on foreign oil could have a long-term impact on the economy, they say, because the price of oil will continue to rise with the demand, and the price of energy could skyrocket in the next decade.\n\n'We Need to Start Thinking Now'\n\n&quot;Energy is not just a topic that's come up in the last few months,&quot; says Matthew Ranson, an analyst with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. &quot;It's been discussed in a serious way for decades now.&quot;\n\nAccording to Ranson, for a long time, people weren't really paying attention to energy issues in this country. But then, he says, &quot;the economy collapsed in the last year or so and the [energy] debate started up again in full force.&quot;\n\nBut even now, he says, &quot;we need to start thinking about it now. We can't just wait.&quot;\n\nThe economy will be hurt most by high energy prices, says Ranson. &quot;Energy, unlike other goods and services, is necessary for people to have jobs and make a living and grow the economy,&quot; he says.\n\nThe crisis is already in the works. &quot;Gas prices are expected to increase at the rate of $3 a year,&quot; Ranson says. &quot;At some point, it's going to make people reconsider car ownership, which we are seeing already.&quot;\n\nOther analysts have noted that the worst economic effects will come in the next few years as oil prices begin to hit consumers' wallets.\n\n&quot;It's really important for people to understand that we don't have to sit around and wait for it to hit us,&quot; Ranson says. &quot;We can do things now to change the way we make energy choices.&quot;\n\nThe United States needs to cut back on our reliance on oil, he says, and start developing clean, domestic energy resources like solar and wind power.\n\n&quot;We need to think differently about the choices that we're making,&quot; he says. &quot;If we have a choice to import oil from places that don't like us, or if we have a choice to invest in clean domestic energy that's good for us, we need to make the choice.&quot;\n\nThe Golden Years\n\nRanson admits that it's not going to be easy to move toward a clean energy economy. But there are things that can be done, such as improving efficiency and investing in new energy technologies. &quot;We can't do everything at once,&quot; he says.\n\nTo help reduce energy demand, Congress has passed a law to require the federal government to improve energy efficiency in its buildings.\n\nThere are also efforts under way to address the energy crisis in cities, where people can be more dependent on energy, according to Ranson.\n\n&quot;A lot of cities are thinking about this in different ways,&quot; he says. &quot;In New York, they're talking about ways to reduce car ownership, like getting people out of cars and into public transportation, making public transportation more convenient, and adding bike paths. You can start with that and see what happens.&quot;\n\nThe Natural Gas Supply\n\nAnother important energy issue to keep an eye on is the country's natural gas supply. Natural gas accounts for nearly 20 percent of the country's energy, and nearly 60 percent of the nation's electricity generation.\n\n&quot;We don't really have a clear understanding of how the supply of natural gas will be affected by what's going on in California,&quot; says Fred Millar, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank, Energy Security Initiative.\n\nMillar believes that the California situation may signal &quot;troubles ahead&quot; for the country's natural gas supply. &quot;There are real questions about how much natural gas is going to be produced by the industry in the coming years,&quot; he says.\n\nThere's been a dramatic drop in natural gas prices in the last few years, and that has encouraged a lot of companies to start new drilling operations, says Millar. But natural gas prices were going up last week, Millar says, and &quot;the question now is, has the bubble burst?&quot;\n\nA recent explosion at a Southern California natural gas pipeline, which took the lives of two workers, has put a halt to natural gas production in the state. The pipeline was owned by the Texas-based company Sempra Energy, and the blast occurred near Bakersfield. It is still unclear what caused the explosion.\n\nThe blast caused a temporary halt to the development of the Puente Valley Pipeline, a major new pipeline project.\n\nMillar says that the halt on the pipeline will have a major effect on the state's energy supplies. &quot;It could cause a major problem for California's electricity supplies,&quot; he says.\n\nMillar adds that the price of natural gas is likely to rise in the coming weeks and months because of the halt.\n\nOil and the Economy\n\nHigh energy prices are also a major concern for economists. &quot;The most immediate effect of a large price increase is inflation,&quot; says David Hughes, a geologist who has written extensively on energy issues. &quot;We can expect energy prices to increase for gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and other fossil fuels.&quot;\n\nBut economists are still debating how the economy will be affected. Some economists say that higher energy prices could have a positive impact on the economy, while others say the impact could be negative.\n\n&quot;It's too early to tell,&quot; says Millar. &quot;We're still in the stage where the price increases are in the process of playing out.&quot;\n\n&quot;The economy is more fragile than it was in the 1970s, and energy is more integrated into the economy, and prices are higher,&quot; says Ranson.\n\nBut he believes that the economy is better positioned to deal with energy prices now than it was in the 1970s. &quot;I don't think the impact of high energy prices will be nearly as bad this time,&quot; he says.\n\nA slowdown in the economy and a possible recession, Ranson says, could cause energy prices to spike even more.\n\nBut even if the economy takes a downturn, Ranson says that energy prices will keep going up. &quot;People may stop spending on some things,&quot; he says, &quot;but energy prices are going to keep going up.&quot;\n\nRanson says that people will have to make choices about how they live, and the government will have to decide how much of a subsidy it's willing to provide for the alternative energy industry.\n\nHughes believes that, ultimately, high energy prices will bring about some kind of economic crisis. &quot;In my view, this is a symptom of a much bigger problem, which is our oil-based economy,&quot; he says. &quot;We can no longer afford the fossil fuel based economy we have had for the past century.&quot;\n\nCopyright 2007 E&amp;E Publishing.

We flew to Seoul Incheon on Cathay Pacific and stayed at the Hyatt in Seoul Station, just outside the hotel station (it was actually our last day before we flew out). We visited the Han River and the Hongdae area (including bars, restaurants and music venues) and went to the Seoul Film Festival. We spent a lot of time walking around too as we don\u2019t really know the city that well and were pretty tired by the end of each day.\n\nWe visited a temple near Cheongdam called Angukdaegyo which was beautiful. We also visited the grounds of the 63 Building which is quite close to the hotel. The following day, we went to Jogyesa Temple which is where the head of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism has his residence. We also went to Cheongwadae which is the residence of the President of Korea and the Blue House. I really wanted to go inside the Blue House but it was closed when we were there. The area around the Blue House was really beautiful.\n\nWe had a really nice lunch at the Daehangno area. We had a really nice lunch at the Dongmyo Station near Gyeongbokgung Palace. The area is quite nice. We then went to Insadong where there were lots of small shops. We also visited Namsangol Hanok Village and had a nice lunch at the Hanok Village. It was also near Gyeonghuigung. We walked up the hills near Gyeonghuigung, which were quite steep and also quite a nice walk. We also visited Seoul Tower which was lovely and there was a great view of Seoul.\n\nWe then travelled to Busan for a day to see the Ulsan Bijudong Cable Car and to take the ferry to Geoje Island. Busan was nice and I can definitely see why people live there. There was a great view of the coast from the cable car. There were quite a lot of islands in Geoje Island. We stayed in the Geoje Island Ferry Cruise which is a small hotel. It was very pleasant there and the food was good. We walked around the island and saw the Minho lighthouse. It was quite cloudy so we couldn\u2019t see the islands around. We stayed for dinner and saw the sunset before we returned to Busan.\n\nOur next destination was Jeju Island. We flew from Busan to Jeju Island on a flight that took about 1 hour. There was also a harbour just outside the hotel. We stayed at the Full Moon Hotel. It was quite beautiful. We visited Hallasan Mountain and the Jeju Haenyeo Museum of Women\u2019s Contributions to Life in the Jeju Island in which there was a lovely view of Hallasan Mountain. We also visited Samcheok Beach. We had a great dinner at the Full Moon Hotel in the Samcheok Bay. There was a beautiful view of the moon rising over the beach from our room.\n\nThe next day, we went to Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, which was very beautiful. It is a volcanic crater on a small island that was completely formed from lava. It was cloudy and rainy while we were there. We went to Seogwipo and had a lovely lunch at Jin Jin Gop. We had a really nice seafood lunch and it was just a couple of minutes away from Seogwipo station. We went to the Seogwipo Lotte Shopping Center and bought some gifts.\n\nWe then went to Hallim Park. It was a very hot day but it was very pleasant there. We went on a cable car to Mount Baekhwa, which was really nice. It is the highest mountain on Jeju Island and the views were nice. We also went to Mokcheongyeon cave and we visited the memorial museum and the huge cave. The cave was really nice and it was a good experience. We then went to Jeju Olle Trail which is a series of pathways that cross Jeju Island. They have been designed to showcase the most beautiful spots on Jeju. We went to the Jeju Olle trail which was near the entrance of Hallim Park. The weather was really nice so it was pleasant to be outside.\n\nWe went to Seongsan Sunrise Peak which was a nice place to see the sunrise. There was a really nice sunset too. The weather was very nice and it was a pleasant place to be. We also went to Mt Sine, which was very pretty. It was a bit foggy and we couldn\u2019t see Mt Halla but it was a nice walk. We also went to the 7 treasures of Jeju which was nice. We then went to Biyang-ri, Seogwipo, which was a bit more rural and very nice.\n\nOur last destination was the Jeju World Cup Stadium. It was a really nice stadium with lots of seating. It had lots of places to eat and drink too.\n\nWe then flew back to Seoul to fly home. It was a lovely place and I can definitely see why people would want to live there.]" time="2.719"><properties><property name="score" value="0.6026448249816895" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[In her interview with Popnography, Kate Micucci discussed her two new projects, BoJack Horseman and another animated series on Yahoo!

Micucci will be joined by a great ensemble of actors including The Hunger Games actor, Sam Richardson, as Commander Glen. Richardson and Micucci previously worked together on Saturday Night Live, and Kate shared how much she loves working with him.\n\nI love working with Sam. He\u2019s so wonderful. He\u2019s so cute.

The kyat was introduced in 1923, replacing the Indian rupee which had been in use in Burma for about two centuries. One kyat is subdivided into 100 pyas, and one kyat is subdivided into 100 cents. Coins have been minted in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kyats, and 1, 5, 10 and 25 pyas, though the highest four denominations are rarely used.\n\nThe coins and notes currently in circulation are:\n\nBanknotes Coins\n\nKyat\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Kyat\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 Pyas\n\n1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 Cents\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Cents\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100\n\nCheck out the latest exchange rates!\n\nMyanmar Currency History\n\nDuring the last half of the 19th century, large quantities of Indian coins circulated in Burma. In 1885, Burma began to issue its own coinage, in a new decimal system. The rupee and the double rupee were equivalent to one kyat. These coins were not for circulation outside of Burma and were not legal tender in India. A similar coinage was issued in the last year of the 19th century, using slightly different weights and diameters for the three silver coins and for the copper coins.\n\nDuring World War I, the Burmese Government began issuing a series of paper notes for 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees. They were overprinted on banknotes of the Imperial Bank of India, the currency used for exchange in Burma until the mid-1930s.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the paper money of several countries was in circulation in Burma. Since the demand for small denomination notes was greatest, the British Government began to issue India notes in 1925. They were of low denomination, being in the denominations of 5, 10 and 20 rupees. The existing paper money was then demonetised.\n\nIn 1940, the Japanese occupied Burma and issued their own notes in place of the British issues. These notes continued to be in use until 1945, when the British re-established control of the country. In 1942, emergency notes were introduced, in the denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 rupees. These notes were overprinted on paper notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nIn 1946, a new series of notes was issued in Burma. This consisted of Indian notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India, overprinted B.E.P. and the State Bank of Burma. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees.\n\nThe present series of notes began in 1951. These notes are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 kyats.\n\nThe &quot;Burmese&quot; rupee, issued by the British between 1885 and 1896, was a fixed exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence (two and one-third rupees).\n\nThe U.S. dollar was established as the national currency of Burma in 1885 and is still the predominant currency in use in Myanmar.\n\nBanking in Myanmar\n\nMyanmar has an international banking system, with at least 7 major banks operating there. These include the state-owned Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and the private Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB), National Bank of Commerce (NBC), Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB), Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), Myanmar Mayflower Bank (MMB), Myanma Ahlia Bank (MAB), and Myanma Security Bank (MSB).\n\nMost commercial banks use the SWIFT system to transfer funds, and many banks in Myanmar accept electronic banking services through mobile phone banking, Internet banking, and ATMs. Some smaller banks still deal only in cash, but since cash is used mainly for larger transactions and shopping, and with so many ATMs in service now, it is no longer a problem.\n\n\n\nMyanmar currency info\n\nMyanmar info\n\nGuide to Myanmar\n\nCurrency information on country homepages]" time="2.201"><properties><property name="score" value="0.012721210718154907" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01272121&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.01272121

This report shows that anti-LGBT victimization in school is a serious problem for a large number of students. It also provides data on other forms of bullying and discriminatory treatment that LGBT students experience. Some of the findings of this report are particularly disturbing. For example, over half (53.1 percent) of LGBT students experienced feeling unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation, over one-quarter (26.1 percent) because of their gender expression, and over one-third (35.2 percent) because of both their sexual orientation and gender expression. This harassment and discrimination takes a toll on these students' well-being. The impact of the harassment and discrimination experienced by LGBT students is serious. LGBT students were more likely than non-LGBT students to report several adverse outcomes. For example, they were more likely than non-LGBT students to report high levels of depression (33.1 percent of LGBT students compared to 19.8 percent of non-LGBT students), to have seriously considered attempting suicide (32.2 percent of LGBT students compared to 13.2 percent of non-LGBT students), and to have made a suicide attempt (21.8 percent of LGBT students compared to 4.3 percent of non-LGBT students). Students who were more highly victimized were also more likely to experience these negative outcomes. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no anti-LGBT victimization, students who experienced a great deal of anti-LGBT victimization were more than three times as likely to have been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (10.0 percent compared to 3.6 percent), more than three times as likely to have been threatened or injured with a weapon off school property (14.7 percent compared to 4.3 percent), more than three times as likely to have experienced school violence (35.2 percent compared to 10.6 percent), more than four times as likely to have attempted suicide (25.0 percent compared to 5.7 percent), and more than six times as likely to have made a suicide attempt that required treatment from a doctor or nurse (10.4 percent compared to 1.8 percent).\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis report presents data from the National School Climate Survey (NCS), which collected data from over 7,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students ages 13\u201321 in public and private schools in every state and the District of Columbia during the spring of 2015. The report focuses on the experiences of LGBT students in public schools, but private school students' experiences are briefly discussed to provide context and additional information about the experiences of LGBT students in schools across the country.1 This report also includes a limited analysis of the data on the experiences of bisexual youth. This report provides the first national data on LGBT students' experiences in our nation's schools.\n\n\nLGBT students face a number of serious challenges at school, and this report provides a comprehensive look at the extent of the problem and its impact on LGBT students. Many LGBT students have experienced verbal harassment, physical assault, and sexual violence at school. For example, over half (53.1 percent) of LGBT students have felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, over one-quarter (26.1 percent) because of their gender expression, and over one-third (35.2 percent) because of both their sexual orientation and gender expression. In addition, over one-third (35.2 percent) of LGBT students have been verbally harassed and 19.6 percent have been physically attacked at school in the past year because of their sexual orientation or gender expression. These figures are even higher for transgender students: over half (53.8 percent) have felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression and over one-third (36.2 percent) because of their gender identity. Furthermore, over one-quarter (27.2 percent) of LGBT students have missed at least one entire day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable, and the prevalence of truancy increases further for transgender students: 40.1 percent of transgender students have missed at least one day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\n\nThis report also shows that the harassment and discrimination that LGBT students experience can lead to serious and negative outcomes for these students, including lower school engagement, lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and higher levels of depression and even higher levels of suicidal behavior. Over one-third (34.7 percent) of LGBT students reported missing school for at least one day during the month before the survey because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable. Students who experienced more victimization because of their LGBT status were also more likely to report this type of adverse outcome. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no victimization, students who experienced a great deal of victimization were almost four times as likely to have missed at least one day of school in the month before the survey because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable (45.6 percent compared to 12.3 percent).\n\n\nThe negative impact of this victimization on LGBT students can be seen in their reports of lower levels of engagement in school activities, lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and higher levels of depression. LGBT students who experienced high levels of victimization because of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or both were more likely than students who experienced low levels of victimization to feel that they could not be themselves at school (68.6 percent compared to 42.2 percent) and to feel unhappy or depressed at school (40.7 percent compared to 19.5 percent). Students who experienced high levels of victimization because of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or both were also more likely to report symptoms of depression than students who experienced low levels of victimization. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no victimization, students who experienced high levels of victimization were almost twice as likely to report feeling unhappy or depressed (38.7 percent compared to 20.2 percent) and almost three times as likely to report feeling less happy than other students (14.3 percent compared to 5.4 percent).\n\n\nData from the 2015 NCS show that many students still face serious and pervasive mistreatment and discrimination at school.

Pollard, whose band just released its 15th album, August By Cake, has lived a life that\u2019s been as varied as it has been eventful. From crafting classic lo-fi pop records and guiding his beloved group to victory after victory for over two decades, to overcoming multiple tragedies that threatened to undo him, Pollard has endured and endured well.\n\nFrom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll heartbreak to musical triumphs and to the stories of his childhood friends who took their own lives, the tales behind Pollard\u2019s life are as varied as the songs he\u2019s written over the years. They\u2019re full of sweetness, heartache and inspiration \u2014 the kind that only music can provide.\n\nHere, Pollard reflects on the enduring and wonderful power of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\n\nOn being inspired by Bob Dylan\n\n\u201cHe made rock \u2018n\u2019 roll feel alive to me, you know? He just did things no one else was doing. The first time I heard his music, I was just in awe of it. I thought he was one of the only people doing something different in music and it really inspired me to make a rock band.\u201d\n\nOn working at Tower Records\n\n\u201cI worked at Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard in the Eighties. I was in a band that was signed to a major label and we were going to go on tour. We were going to make our first big move out to L.A. and the band broke up in Pittsburgh. I was heartbroken. I went to L.A. anyway and got a job at Tower and the band started to do really well in Pittsburgh. I started to realize that I was being a moron by working at a job that didn\u2019t have anything to do with music. I should have been playing music.\n\n\u201cThen, I met people that worked at the store \u2014 people that worked in the music section \u2014 and they were people that were into the same kind of music that I was. They were all very into the new wave thing that was going on at that time and I was very into the punk scene and I was discovering all this underground music. That was a good time because I was discovering so many great bands and all these great people.\u201d\n\nOn putting together Guided By Voices\n\n\u201cI was living in this little house on Cass Avenue in Detroit and I would just record these songs in the basement. I didn\u2019t think anyone would be interested. I just thought I was doing this for myself. Then, people started calling me and saying they wanted to play on the songs and asking if I could make copies of them. Eventually, I had enough to make a record. I was putting the band together around the same time.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, it was just one song. The whole point was to just have one song on a compilation of different artists from Michigan. That was the point of the whole thing. It was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s fun. That\u2019s really fun. Let\u2019s do another song.\u2019 It just became something else. Then, I started working with the other people. The other people were my friends. My friends were just my buddies that I\u2019d played music with. The first couple of years was just me and my buddies doing these songs. Then, it started to become a bigger thing and we started to tour and it became something else. It just turned into something else. It was an accident that it happened.\u201d\n\nOn his songwriting approach\n\n\u201cMy songs have always come from an unconscious, naive place. I really have to focus on a song and work on a song in order for it to have a definite melody or a definite idea. The words, I kind of write more like a novel and I try to write songs that work like a story. When I\u2019m doing them, I\u2019m trying to do it like a movie. I\u2019m trying to think of it in terms of a movie and I\u2019m trying to create characters and set the scenes and tell the story and make it a little bit deeper than what you would normally expect from a pop song. I\u2019m trying to take it to a different level in some ways. That\u2019s always been my goal and that\u2019s always been my style.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to reinvent the wheel, I just think that I\u2019m trying to take things that are already in existence and make them bigger and more beautiful and a little more complete. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really try to analyze it that much. I\u2019ve always written songs in the same way and the only thing that\u2019s changed is the way I record them. I used to record them all on a boombox and then, as we went along, we started to get more and more into studio work.\u201d\n\nOn recording songs at home\n\n\u201cI like to record in a place that\u2019s not a studio. I\u2019ve always liked to record in a place where I could have access to as much stuff as possible. I really enjoy it when I have a lot of cool things to play with. I always like to record at home. I think it\u2019s important to make the place you record at like a laboratory, you know? I like to have it be a lab. If I could, I\u2019d have every piece of equipment ever made and be able to put it all in one room and be able to experiment with every sound I could possibly make. It\u2019s so much fun and it\u2019s so much work at the same time, too. I love it.\u201d\n\nOn his songwriting process\n\n\u201cThe way I work, I just keep track of my thoughts and feelings. I think about it when I\u2019m walking or when I\u2019m eating or I\u2019m just doing stuff. I just keep track of stuff and I write down a lot of notes and I try to pay attention to things. My life is so boring, really, you know? I don\u2019t do anything that exciting. I just pay attention to things and I think about stuff and I write down little ideas. I do that all the time. I write little ideas all the time and I just try to remember them and try to put them in a folder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a filing system. The filing system is in my head. I try to remember everything I think about and I try to write it down and then, eventually, it becomes a song. Then, I try to look at the songs that are done and I try to pick the ones that seem to be the best and start thinking about them in terms of a story or a character or a scenario or something that would be entertaining. I have to think about all the things that are going on in my life and try to piece things together like a collage.\n\n\u201cThen, when it comes to the recording, I\u2019m thinking about the whole thing as a complete package. I\u2019m thinking about the sound of it and I\u2019m thinking about how I\u2019m going to mix the album and everything. I\u2019m thinking about the lyrics and the voice. Everything is kind of part of a bigger thing and the sound and the performance is really important.\u201d\n\nOn keeping it simple\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to write when you\u2019re just keeping it simple. When you start to complicate things, it becomes too big of a thing to think about. That\u2019s when the song becomes too precious and you can\u2019t finish it or you start getting scared of it or something like that. Then, you get caught up in the emotion of it and you can\u2019t do it. You have to remember that it\u2019s just something you\u2019re doing to pass the time. It\u2019s just something you\u2019re doing for fun. That\u2019s what it is for me. It\u2019s just fun. I\u2019m not trying to be any big shot or anything like that. I\u2019m just trying to do something that\u2019s fun and I\u2019m just trying to make something that\u2019s going to give me some satisfaction. I\u2019m just trying to do something that\u2019s going to be fun to listen to and fun to make.\u201d\n\nOn his songwriting being like therapy\n\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m not trying to be a serious writer or anything like that. I\u2019m not trying to be pretentious at all. I just want to make a record that I\u2019d like to listen to.\u201d\n\nOn the joy of performing\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling, you know? There\u2019s something very satisfying about it. You just can\u2019t stop it, you know? I\u2019ve been doing it for so long and it just doesn\u2019t go away. You can\u2019t stop it. I just keep on doing it and I can\u2019t stop it. I think that\u2019s the reason why I do it, you know?\u201d\n\nOn discovering The Beatles\n\n\u201cThe Beatles made]" time="4.951"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997810274362564" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 An American Airlines pilot has been removed from flying duties after he temporarily parked a plane on a taxiway where four other airliners were waiting to take off at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.\n\nAn investigation into the Saturday incident is ongoing, airline spokesman Ross Feinstein said Sunday.\n\nFeinstein said the pilot has been taken off flying duty &quot;pending the outcome of the investigation.&quot; He didn't specify how long the pilot would be grounded.\n\nNo other crew members were disciplined, and the incident won't affect the scheduling of the roughly 3,000 flights a day the airline operates around the world, Feinstein said.\n\nHe declined to release the name of the pilot or the number of years he had been flying for the airline.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that the pilot of the American Airlines plane, which had arrived from Nashville, Tenn., was supposed to go to a designated taxiway but instead went to a parallel taxiway where four other airliners were waiting for clearance to take off.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how close the plane came to taking off.\n\nAccording to radar information cited in the aviation department statement, the aircraft came within 100 feet of an aircraft on the ground and approximately 200 feet from another aircraft.\n\nThe aviation department is investigating the incident along with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAmerican Airlines has endured two crashes this year and five in 2015.

What happens when you decide to make a new product and to have a bigger impact? You might think that you have to start with an already existing product and create something new. But this is not always true.\n\nSometimes you need to start from scratch and create something new \u2013 a new form, a new material, new applications or new customer experiences. This is what happened when Ikea created the L\xd6MSK light collection \u2013 a range of products made of plaster and leather, using two materials that we usually associate with other products.\n\nL\xd6MSK: it\xb4s easy being a one-of-a-kind light\n\nTwo elements were the starting point of the L\xd6MSK light collection: an existing material and a very unusual use for it. Plaster and leather are very traditional materials that are linked to very different products. We know plaster for its use in wallpapers, ceilings and sculptures, but it is not very common to use it in products such as lights or furniture. Leather has a much stronger association with leather goods, clothes, bags or shoes. And in fact, leather is one of the most used materials in the furniture industry.\n\nTwo products, plaster and leather, that are very common to different types of industries but never used together.\n\nIkea wanted to combine these two materials in a collection of lights, lamps and other decorative elements, in order to make a complete lighting system that can be easily incorporated into any interior and made more personal.\n\nA creative team started exploring ways of using these two materials in a complete lighting collection. They started experimenting with different elements such as the light bulb and the suspension, to combine them and to make sure they can adapt to the maximum number of situations. The development of the light was not a process of making a more perfect product, but rather a process of exploring new ways of using existing products.\n\nAs a result, they developed three series of products. One made of plaster and leather, and two others made of plaster. The leather light is one of the most surprising elements in the collection, as it is hard to believe that this kind of leather is the same that we see in jackets or shoes.\n\nThe leather used in the light is dyed in different colours in order to add interest to the design and it is used to create the \u201cU\u201d shape that holds the light bulb. This element was designed to be a flexible element in the light, allowing the user to change the direction of the light and adapt it to different uses.\n\nFinally, the leather light can also be suspended with a wire, making it ideal for reading lights.\n\nThe second series, made of plaster, is the plateroom series, and the third series is a collection of lamps made of plaster with different shades. The aim was to use plaster to make different types of lamps that can adapt to the different sizes of space. This is achieved by combining the plaster with different shades and creating elements such as the plateroom bench and the plateroom table, with different dimensions and shades.\n\nThere is an important message that Ikea wants to communicate with this collection: that it is possible to create something new and original.\n\nYou need to start with something simple but at the same time creative and unusual. This is what Ikea wants to achieve with this collection: creating a new product that is easy to understand and appreciate, but at the same time has an innovative design and can be used in different types of interior.\n\nThis can be achieved by starting with a very simple element and having an open mind, as the designers did with this collection. Ikea has created a very unusual product that is adaptable to different situations and can be adapted to any kind of interior or architecture.]" time="2.032"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9851841926574707" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Good for price\n\nBy Anonymous\n\n06 Apr 2012\n\nShimano PD-T400 SPD Pedals\n\n3 / 5\n\nI recommend this product\n\nCons rubber grip strip wears quickly, not made to wear a cleat off road or in the mud Pros inexpensive, comfortable, easy to adjust, replaceable\n\nMy first set lasted me 4 years on the commuter bike and MTB with up to 50 mile/week rides.

Although he served almost the entire war in the eastern theater, his most significant contributions were in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, which ended in the stalemate at Petersburg, Virginia, and the capture of the Union garrison at Lynchburg, Virginia. Early is considered among the best Confederate generals who never served in the Army of Northern Virginia.\n\nEarly was born in Southampton County, Virginia, the seventh of ten children of Ruth (Anderson) Early and Judge John Early, a former governor of Virginia and member of the United States Congress. In 1825, Early attended Charlotte Hall Military Academy. He graduated second in his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1838, placing him above such future generals as Stonewall Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nEarly was appointed a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. He served as an aide to General Winfield Scott in the War with Mexico and fought in the Battle of Molino del Rey and the Battle of Chapultepec. Early served as the acting chief of artillery in the assault on the city of Mexico, and received two brevets for his bravery in these battles. He was one of the first officers to enter Mexico City, and he served as an artillery instructor at West Point from 1847 to 1852. Early served as a major in the United States Army in the Seminole Wars in 1855, and as a captain in the United States Dragoons in 1858.\n\nEarly entered the Virginia Military Institute in 1852, and became a professor of mathematics at the Institute, where he taught until the Civil War. He was known for his severity as a disciplinarian. Early became known as a superb military tactician and administrator, as well as an able administrator and strategist.\n\nIn 1860, Early entered politics, running as a Democrat for one of the two seats in the Virginia House of Delegates from Southampton County, but he was defeated. The state seceded from the Union on April 17, 1861, and Early was commissioned as a colonel of artillery in the Virginia militia on May 14. When Virginia militia units were activated for Confederate service, Early was appointed a brigadier general of Virginia forces on May 27.\n\nEarly initially commanded a brigade in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett. When Garnett died at the Battle of Mill Springs, Early was promoted to brigadier general on January 16, 1862. His brigade was assigned to Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith's division in the Army of Northern Virginia. Early fought in the Peninsula Campaign, including the Siege of Yorktown, during which his brigade was an important factor in repulsing a Union assault on the right flank of the Confederate entrenchments at Savage's Station. Early received praise for his actions at Hanover Court House.\n\nEarly distinguished himself during the Seven Days Battles. He received his commission as a major in the Confederate Regular Army on June 9, 1862, but was later returned to his previous rank of colonel in the reserves. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, he received plaudits for his actions at the Second Battle of Bull Run.\n\nEarly was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate regular army on October 11, 1862. He was given command of a brigade in Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division of A.P. Hill's III Corps. During the Maryland Campaign, Early performed well at the Battle of South Mountain.\n\nDuring the Battle of Fredericksburg, Early was severely wounded in the right thigh and temporarily assigned to administrative duties. He returned to the field in time to defeat Union Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's offensive at the Battle of Chancellorsville. At Chancellorsville, Early performed ably in combat and earned praise for his conduct as a brigade commander. Early was sent to western Virginia, where he defeated Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans at the Battle of Mill Springs. After Chancellorsville, Early was promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier general in the Confederate Regular Army on May 21, 1863, and given command of a division.\n\nEarly fought under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Early's old brigade was reassigned to Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson. The Second Battle of Kernstown was his most significant contribution during the Valley Campaigns. Following the Valley Campaigns, Early was assigned to Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge's command in the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nHe conducted the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Following Early's victory at the Battle of Lynchburg in June 1864, Early's army became separated by Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter's raid. Hunter's force was driven from the Valley in the Battle of Lynchburg by Early's troops. During the Valley Campaigns, Early defeated Union Maj. Gen. George Crook at the Battle of Rutherford's Farm and the Battle of Tom's Brook, drove Maj. Gen. David Hunter from the Valley in the Second Battle of Kernstown, and defeated Union Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan at the Third Battle of Winchester.\n\nEarly defeated Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter's Valley Campaign in the Second Battle of Kernstown in July 1864. He then crossed into Maryland and threatened Washington, D.C., forcing Grant to send reinforcements to the capital area. During the subsequent Valley Campaigns of 1864, Early defeated Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan at the Battle of Opequon, the Third Battle of Winchester, and the Battle of Fisher's Hill. Sheridan's victory at the Battle of Cedar Creek forced Early to retreat back to the Valley.\n\nEarly was assigned to the Department of the West and ordered to reinforce the Confederate Army of Tennessee, but Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge convinced him to resist Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's advance. At the beginning of the Atlanta Campaign, Early was given command of the newly created Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee. During the Battle of Resaca, he launched an unsuccessful assault against a Union fortification on the western bank of the Oostenaula River, suffering heavy casualties. During the subsequent battles of Adairsville and Cassville, his corps attempted to flank Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's left flank, but his subordinates were slow in attacking and failed to coordinate their movements with other Confederate forces. After the Confederates suffered defeat at the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Early retreated with his corps to Lovejoy's Station. He ordered Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham's division to open the Battle of Atlanta by attacking the Union force under Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. Early was in the town of Marietta when he learned that Lt. Gen. John B. Hood was wounded during the Battle of Atlanta, and he returned to Atlanta to take command of the army.\n\nDuring the subsequent Siege of Atlanta, the Army of Tennessee lacked provisions and was forced to withdraw from Atlanta. The army was defeated during the subsequent pursuit, and Early's corps was heavily engaged at the Battle of Ezra Church. In November 1864, the Army of Tennessee was reorganized and Early was given command of the new Second Corps. At the Battle of Franklin, he was killed by a shot through the heart, and his corps suffered significant casualties. The Second Corps was commanded by Maj. Gen. William B. Bate after Early's death. Bate was also wounded and captured, and the corps was virtually destroyed. Bate's capture led to another shakeup of the army's command structure, and Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart assumed command of the Second Corps.\n\nEarly was buried at the Old Methodist Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia, but the cemetery closed and his remains were moved to Richmond National Cemetery.\n\nThe Virginia Historical Society operates the Jubal Early Memorial Cemetery near New Market, Virginia, where he is buried.\n\nEarly was known as &quot;Old Jubal&quot; to his men and &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; to his friends. Confederate General Robert E. Lee was a friend of Early's, and named his youngest son, Jubal Anderson, after him.\n\nIn the film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, Early was portrayed by actor Martin Sheen. The movie presented Early as a vain, glory-seeking but weak commander who bickered with fellow Confederate generals Joseph E. Johnston and James Longstreet over who was in command of the Army of Tennessee.\n\nHe is also featured in Jeff Shaara's &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; trilogy, where he is portrayed by Jon Voight.\n\nThe James River Squadron was a Confederate Navy organization during the American Civil War which operated on the James River, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n]" time="4.573"><properties><property name="score" value="0.738131602605184" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Bangalore United\n\nBangalore United is a men's team of the Bangalore United Football Club.\n\nIn the past Bangalore United Football Club had two men's teams, Bangalore FC and Bangalore United.\n\nBangalore United FC was a founder member of the I-League in 2007 and competed in the first season of the competition, finishing in third place in the Southern Group.

He is popularly known as the father of the profession and he was born in Paris, the son of Pierre Le N\xf4tre, a painter of miniatures and Marie Le N\xf4tre. He was trained in his fathers occupation, he did some paintings by the time he was sixteen. He travelled to Italy with Pierre Berchet in 1640, and worked with the architect Jacques Lemercier, from 1646 he was occupied with architectural drawing for the Louvre. He was made a member of the Acad\xe9mie at Mans in 1650, Le N\xf4tres first known landscape project was at the ch\xe2teau of Vaux-le-Vicomte, for his distant relative, Nicolas Fouquet. Here he was more open to the imagination, transforming the plan into a Picturesque and Romantic garden. His work showed a tendency towards the natural and asymmetrical, Le N\xf4tre was unable to visit Italy on account of wars with the Italian states. His influence was limited to parts of the northeast of France, Le N\xf4tres first projects in this style were done for the court of the prince de Cond\xe9. The ch\xe2teau of Chantilly, belonging to the princess of Cond\xe9, Fran\xe7ois, Le N\xf4tre achieved the most at the Ch\xe2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, for Louis XIV and his duc de Bourgogne, later the duc dOrl\xe9ans. Le N\xf4tre created a estate at Marly, and, at the Trianon, for the young Louis XIV. His work transformed the old fort into a palace, more suitable for the residence of the king. He is also responsible for the landscapes of the gardens of the Ch\xe2teau de Maisons and Ch\xe2teau de Saint-Cloud, Le N\xf4tre died in 1681, and was succeeded by his son Jean-Charles Le N\xf4tre, to whom he had taught his encyclopedic style, and his son-in-law Fran\xe7ois Dunan. The design of the gardens of the Ch\xe2teau de Marly was a project of Le N\xf4tres. They were designed to be seen from the top of the terrace, the perspectives and size of the gardens were calculated to surprise the spectators. Le N\xf4tre planned the gardens following the Renaissance principles of regularity, symmetry and he was also responsible for the modifications made to the original plan, done by Charles Le Brun and the gardener Martin Charbonnier, who remade the terrace and the parterres. The final result was the ancestor of modern formal gardens, in 1660 and 1661, Le N\xf4tre built two mansions on the Place Royale in Paris, for the jewellers Louis de Lancy and Balthazar Claquin. In 1664, Le N\xf4tre and Claude Perrault collaborated on a project for the west side of the Louvre. Le N\xf4tres last landscape was the garden around the ch\xe2teau de Sceaux, a project which was incomplete at the time of his death in 1681\n\n9. Gardens of Versailles \u2013 The Gardens of Versailles occupy part of what was once the Domaine royal de Versailles, the royal demesne of the ch\xe2teau of Versailles. Situated to the west of the palace, the gardens cover some 800 hectares of land, in addition to the meticulous manicured lawns, parterres of flowers, and sculptures are the fountains, which are located throughout the garden. Dating from the time of Louis XIV and still using much of the network of hydraulics as was used during the Ancien R\xe9gime. On weekends from spring to early autumn, the administration of the museum sponsors the Grandes Eaux \u2013 spectacles during which all the fountains in the gardens are in full play. In 1979, the gardens along with the ch\xe2teau were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, one of thirty-one such designations in France. With Louis XIII\u2019s final purchase of lands from Jean-Fran\xe7ois de Gondi in 1632 and his assumption of the role of Versailles in the 1630s. Records indicate that late in the decade Claude Mollet and Hilaire Masson designed the gardens and this early layout, which has survived in the so-called Du Bus plan of c.1662, shows an established topography along which lines of the gardens evolved. This is evidenced in the definition of the main east-west. From this point forward, the expansion of the gardens of Versailles followed the expansions of the ch\xe2teau, accordingly, Louis XIVs building campaigns apply to the gardens as well. At every stage the prescribed tour was managed, under the Sun Kings directions. First building campaign In 1662, minor modifications to the ch\xe2teau were undertaken, existing bosquets and parterres were expanded and new ones created. Most significant among the creations at this time were the Orangerie, the Versailles Orangery, which was designed by Louis Le Vau, was located south of the ch\xe2teau, a situation that took advantage of the natural slope of the hill. It provided an area in which orange trees were kept during the winter months. The Grotte de Th\xe9tys, which was located to the north of the ch\xe2teau, formed part of the iconography of the ch\xe2teau, the grotto would be completed during the second building campaign. By 1664, the gardens had evolved to the point that Louis XIV inaugurated the gardens with the f\xeate galante called Les Plaisirs de l\u2019\xcele Enchant\xe9e. The event, which officially was to celebrate his mother, Anne d\u2019Autriche, guests were regaled with fabulous entertainments in the gardens over a period of one week. As a result of this f\xeate \u2013 particularly the lack of housing for guests, Louis realized the shortcomings of Versailles and began to expand the ch\xe2teau and the gardens once again. With this new phase of construction, the gardens assumed the topographical and iconological design vocabulary that would remain in force until the 18th century. \u201d\n\n10. French language \u2013 French is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages, French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues do\xefl\u2014languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to Frances past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, a French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French. French is a language in 29 countries, most of which are members of la francophonie. As of 2015, 40% of the population is in Europe, 35% in sub-Saharan Africa, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas. French is the fourth-most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union, 1/5 of Europeans who do not have French as a mother tongue speak French as a second language. As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 17th and 18th century onward, French was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa, most second-language speakers reside in Francophone Africa, in particular Gabon, Algeria, Mauritius, Senegal and Ivory Coast. In 2015, French was estimated to have 77 to 110 million native speakers, approximately 274 million people are able to speak the language. The Organisation internationale de la Francophonie estimates 700 million by 2050, in 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese. Under the Constitution of France, French has been the language of the Republic since 1992. France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education except in specific cases, French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland called Romandie, of which Geneva is the largest city. French is the language of about 23% of the Swiss population. French is also a language of Luxembourg, Monaco, and Aosta Valley, while French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands. A plurality of the worlds French-speaking population lives in Africa and this number does not include the people living in non-Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language. Due to the rise of French in Africa, the total French-speaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050, French is the fastest growing language on the continent. French is mostly a language in Africa, but it has become a first language in some urban areas, such as the region of Abidjan, Ivory Coast and in Libreville. There is not a single African French, but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages, sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth\n\n11. Garden \u2013 A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials, the most common form today is known as a residential garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one.

I\u2019ve now had the second generation of the iPod nano for about a week and wanted to give you my thoughts about it.\n\n(Last Updated: Nov 12th, 2012)\n\nThe Physical Design\n\nI think Apple got this design right with the nano. It\u2019s very thin and light, which I like. It\u2019s almost identical to the 1st gen nano, but thinner, and with a larger screen. The big deal for me is that it is so much thinner and smaller than the previous nano. I don\u2019t know why I like that so much, but it does make it so much easier to carry around.\n\nThe Screen\n\nI was initially concerned about the small size of the screen. My fear was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see the screen as well, or that it would be harder to navigate the menus. I\u2019m very happy to report that the screen size is perfect for what I want. I think the new screen is just large enough to easily navigate menus and change songs.\n\nThe Sound Quality\n\nI was very skeptical about the new sound quality. I don\u2019t have a lot of time to listen to music, and when I do, I usually do it while at the gym. So for me, sound quality is not a huge priority, but I was concerned about it with the new nano.\n\nWell, I am very happy to say that the sound quality is much better than the first generation nano. It is not better than my 4th gen iPod touch, but it is about the same, and sounds really good to me.\n\nThe Battery Life\n\nThe battery life of the new nano is what I was most worried about. The previous nano only got about 5 hours of battery life when playing music, and this is the same battery as the first generation nano. But I was pleasantly surprised by the new nano. It only lasts about 8 hours, but that\u2019s fine for me. My goal is to carry a nano that can give me 8 hours of listening time at the gym. The only time I need longer than that is when I\u2019m traveling for work, and I have my iPhone with me for music.\n\nThe Software\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into too much detail here, but I am very happy with the new software. I think the new interface looks great and I love that I can easily make the album art fit the screen perfectly.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I\u2019m very happy with the new iPod nano 2G. It is the perfect size and weight for me. It sounds good, and the battery life is good enough for me. It\u2019s nice to have an iPod that\u2019s small enough to fit in my pocket.\n\nI would definitely recommend the new iPod nano. If you already have a 1st gen nano, the only reason to upgrade is for the size.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, is that Apple has said that]" time="1.582"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997828205426534" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Advanced Biological Warfare (ABW)\n\nThere is an urgent need for &quot;offensive&quot; biological warfare (BW) capability, to complement defensive measures against an attack with biological weapons (BW). Existing defensive measures provide only limited protection against BW, and their usefulness would be significantly reduced in some circumstances. No acceptable defenses have been developed against BW agents.\n\nThis lack of adequate defenses against biological weapons is a major vulnerability in the security of the United States. The increasing danger that biological weapons will be used for hostile purposes poses an urgent need to counter the threat.\n\nModern biological warfare could include development and use of pathogenic organisms and toxins, as well as incapacitating agents. The former might well be the only BW agent of concern because of their potential for causing mass casualties.\n\nThe widespread use of modern technology has increased the availability of biological materials for use as BW agents. Current medical knowledge has increased the potential to create and spread biological weapons. This trend is expected to continue.\n\nEarly development and testing of a pathogenic agent for use in an offensive BW program would not be easily detectable. A biological agent can be disseminated in many ways and to many places with little warning. It is difficult to effectively monitor, detect, and decontaminate a wide area after an attack.\n\nStrategic Offensive Biological Warfare\n\nStrategic offensive BW provides the United States with a major deterrent against potential adversaries. As a deterrent weapon, strategic offensive BW can have a significant impact on the overall military posture of the United States and its potential adversaries. It is in the national interest of the United States to develop a military biological capability to deter an adversary from using biological weapons.\n\nStrategic offensive BW will be used against enemy personnel or facilities to inflict maximum casualties, degrade military capability, or destroy life-sustaining resources or capabilities. In military operations, strategic offensive BW would be used as part of a coordinated effort, in conjunction with other conventional and nuclear forces, and it would require integration of tactical, operational, and strategic capabilities.\n\nStrategic offensive BW could be employed by the United States to complement and support its defensive and non-military (e.g., diplomatic, political, economic, and legal) measures in the event of a biological attack. Its primary purpose would be to minimize the impact of a biological attack on the United States or its forces. Strategic offensive BW may also have applications in countering adversaries that are seeking to develop and maintain a BW capability.\n\nNon-Strategic Offensive Biological Warfare\n\nNon-strategic offensive BW may be employed in support of specific military operations against specific adversary targets. It may also be used in support of other military operations. It would be used to complement and support defensive and non-military measures in the event of a biological attack.\n\nNon-strategic offensive BW would be limited in scope and duration, but it would still be considered offensive because it would result in the infliction of casualties. Non-strategic offensive BW would be used against specific targets, rather than against a large area. It would normally be employed in peacetime as a form of anticipatory self-defense, rather than as a weapon of last resort. Non-strategic offensive BW could be conducted clandestinely to avoid a general war.\n\nThe possession of non-strategic offensive BW capabilities would enhance the deterrent posture of the United States. It would enhance US options to counter biological threats. These options include military action and other non-military actions, which could preclude the need for a military response.\n\nThe National Military Strategy (NMS) endorses non-strategic offensive BW as a credible deterrent to aggression against US interests. The NMS identifies two levels of non-strategic offensive BW for deterrence: A highly credible threat to use BW agents in response to biological attacks or a threat to use BW agents in response to a biological attack. The NMS also identifies a low-level but still credible threat to use BW agents to counter limited biological attacks, sabotage, and hostage-taking.\n\nGlobal Issues\n\nThe US BW program is important to national security and international stability. A fundamental premise of US policy is that offensive BW capabilities are legitimate instruments of national power, especially if the United States is threatened by chemical or biological weapons. The United States has an interest in dissuading the proliferation of BW programs. The development of offensive capabilities by countries without chemical or biological weapons programs or doctrines would be destabilizing and increase the likelihood of their use. The growth of indigenous BW programs in countries with other WMD programs would have similar destabilizing effects.\n\nInternational stability is jeopardized when there is uncertainty as to whether nations will abide by international legal commitments regarding BW. The US BW program is not intended to influence foreign countries, but to demonstrate the US commitment to deter the use of biological weapons and to respond if deterrence fails. BW will be maintained as a credible deterrent, but not one that would have to be used. The United States should make clear its continued intention to pursue an effective BW program to deter adversaries, if necessary.\n\nUS non-strategic offensive BW is an important element of national power and US leadership in arms control. The US BW program plays a crucial role in US leadership in arms control. Non-strategic offensive BW is necessary for full compliance with existing and emerging arms control and non-proliferation agreements. It is important for successful implementation of the CWC, the BWC, and other regional and international agreements. This would prevent the proliferation of BW programs in countries with other WMD programs.\n\nInterdiction\n\nThe inherent characteristics of biological agents make them suitable for clandestine delivery and easy to disseminate. Biological agents could be delivered clandestinely to specific personnel or facilities in areas under control of a potential adversary, without risk to the agents\u2019 handlers.\n\nThe ability of an adversary to clandestinely deliver a biological agent makes the effectiveness of a traditional containment strategy, such as is used in the management of nuclear, chemical, and missile proliferation, problematic. A defensive strategy for biological weapons will have limited utility.\n\nInterdiction of a clandestine BW attack would require significant intelligence resources and considerable time. It would be difficult to find the attacking agent, assess the magnitude of the attack, and identify the source of the attack. If it is found, the agents are difficult to detect and are difficult to destroy. In the unlikely event that a clandestine BW attack were detected and stopped before any damage occurred, the United States would have to consider the political and military implications of conducting an extensive search for the source of the BW attack.\n\nIf an adversary does attempt to use BW, the United States would have to consider the implications of an extensive search for the source of the attack, whether it should be attempted, and what political and military actions might result. US policy is to discourage development of BW programs in countries without other WMD programs, but to take BW programs in friendly countries into account. Therefore, the United States would have to consider how the public and international community would react to the use of US resources to search for a biological attack.\n\nBiological Weapons Control\n\nUnited States policy is to discourage countries from developing and using BW and to discourage the proliferation of BW.\n\nThe United States wants to minimize the risk of WMD proliferation and to prevent or mitigate the harmful consequences of proliferation. Because BW programs are easier to develop and conceal than are nuclear, chemical, and missile programs, US policy is to take appropriate measures to minimize the risk of proliferation of BW. In the case of US friends and allies, it will consider the importance of the BW program to the defense of the country and its overall relations with that country.\n\nBiological weapons could be used in conjunction with nuclear, chemical, or other weapons. This possibility increases the potential threat posed by BW. The United States has concluded that the worldwide prohibition of BW would not eliminate the threat of their use. Although the worldwide elimination of BW is a long-term goal, there is no realistic means to reach it in the foreseeable future. The United States will continue to work toward that goal, but in the meantime it will maintain an effective BW deterrent.\n\nFormal arms control, including international verification of BW programs, would not be sufficient to prevent the clandestine development and use of BW. Biological weapons can be developed and used without a massive infrastructure. Interdiction of clandestine BW programs may not be successful. A country with both BW and chemical weapons programs would be able to attack with biological weapons without any risk of exposure of its chemical weapons program. The United States will seek to work with friendly countries to prevent proliferation of BW.\n\nThe United States would oppose a global ban on the development, possession, or use of BW because it is not a realistic possibility. Such a ban would not eliminate the threat of BW. It would be easy to evade a ban and difficult to enforce.\n\nThe United States will continue to work with the international community to reach an effective and acceptable solution to the BW problem.\n\nTechnical Issues\n\nThe United States does not want to be vulnerable to BW, and it must be able to meet the challenge of a biological attack. However, the US BW program will not be capable of protecting the United States against a chemical or nuclear attack, nor will it be able to protect against all types of biological weapons.\n\nThere is no defense against BW. The United States does not want to be vulnerable to BW. However, if an adversary did use BW, the United States would be willing to use its offensive BW capability to counter it.\n\nThere are no weapons systems or defensive measures capable of protecting against all types of biological warfare. However, a significant deterrent can be developed to dissuade potential adversaries from using BW. This would require BW programs to develop and maintain a viable capability to inflict casualties, degradation of military capability, or destruction of life-sustaining resources or capabilities.\n\nThe likelihood that a biological attack would be effective is low. The impact of biological weapons would be low compared to that of nuclear, chemical]" time="4.962"><properties><property name="score" value="0.813485942103646" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Punto Fijo Municipality\n\nPunto Fijo is one of the 21 municipalities (municipios) of the state of Yaracuy, Venezuela.

Ion beam studies of materials use mass spectrometry to study materials. Ion beam analysis is the name used for the techniques developed to study the solid materials with either a gas or a particle beam. Particle beams are commonly produced by ion guns or by secondary ion mass spectrometry. For high resolution, single particle mass spectrometry (called single particle IBA) or time of flight (TOF) instruments are employed. For many studies, electron microscopes can be used with appropriate detectors.\n\nSingle particle mass spectrometry was invented by Herb Guyer and Edward A. Heineman at Cornell University in 1953. This technique was the foundation of the field of ion beam analysis. This technique has been used to study a wide range of materials including metals, ceramics, glasses, organics and polymers.\n\nIn this technique the ion beam is focused to a small spot size on the sample, either by focusing in a magnetic or an electrostatic field or by being focused by electrostatic fields in a multielectrode system. The beam is then scanned over the surface of the sample. For each sample point, a mass spectrum of the sample material is obtained. The signals from the individual elements in the sample are then compared to each other in order to determine the composition and/or structure of the sample. This is because the signals are characteristic of the elements from which they are produced. The process of matching up the signals is called deconvolution. In this technique, the detector signal is measured only when a particle of the beam is detected.\n\nThe disadvantage of this technique is that it requires much more time to measure each sample point compared to scanning probe microscopes (which use electron beams).\n\nThe electron microscope with a detector attached to it can be used as an IBA tool. It is very useful to study the microstructure of ceramics and glasses.\n\nThe technique was developed at Cornell University and its name was coined by Thomas Vale in 1959. In electron microscope IBA, the sample is placed on a thin window and a beam of electrons is directed at it. The beam of electrons is either the electron beam itself or the secondary electron beam produced by a beam of primary electrons.\n\nWhen the electron beam is directed at the sample, some of the electrons are absorbed by the sample. This produces electrons inside the material and some ions. The ions are extracted by an electric field and are accelerated. The electrons emitted from the ions are detected. The detector may be a microchannel plate (MCP) detector or an electron multiplier.\n\nIn these systems the electron beam is accelerated between two plates.

The organisation was accused of losing sensitive personal data on more than 10 million people in an unencrypted CD in 2015, and was also accused of sending the wrong letters to half a million people.\n\nIt has also been criticised for a raid on the offices of investigative reporters at The Guardian.\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: \u2018It has become clear that our compliance data is not fully comparable over time, and we will not be publishing it in this form again. This does not affect the overall tax gap and our published estimates of the tax gap for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 have not changed.\u2019\n\nA statement on the HMRC website said that the data published on 31 August \u2018estimated the total tax gap to be \xa333.2 billion for the year 2015-16. This figure represents a decrease of \xa34.7 billion on the 2014-15 tax gap of \xa338.9 billion, or a 14 per cent decrease\u2019.\n\nBut it admitted that the figure included \u2018incorrect estimates\u2019 on income tax, VAT and customs duty.\n\n\u2018We have corrected this error and published revised estimates for income tax, VAT and customs duty. These estimates now estimate the total tax gap to be \xa339.5 billion for the year 2015-16, which is an increase of \xa34.3 billion on the 2014-15 tax gap of \xa335.2 billion,\u2019 it said.\n\n\u2018This increase in the tax gap is not a true reflection of what has happened in compliance.

What is an ATC and how do I use one? An ATC is an automatic transfer switch. It is used to transfer power to the boiler in the event of a power failure. These switches are &quot;automatic&quot; in the sense that they monitor the power flow through the generator and as soon as the power goes off, they engage the transfer switch (in parallel to the house breaker) to power the boiler. When the power is restored, the ATC turns off and disconnects the power to the boiler, restoring the house power. (We are not responsible for damages caused by not following these instructions). Before starting to install the system, you need to find the right place to put your ATC switch. Some considerations include: 1. You should put your ATC as close to the back of the generator as possible. This will make it easier for you to wire it up. 2. It is important to find a place that is dry. You can't use an ATC outside. It will just short out if it gets wet. 3. It needs to be in an accessible place (inside your home). It doesn't need to be near the breaker box (but it should be near a wall outlet). 4. The ATC should be installed at least 3 feet from the nearest source of water (sump pump, water heater, etc.) 5.

How about better user experience? There are many ways you can accomplish both.\n\n1. Reduce your page\u2019s load time\n\nGoogle uses the page load time as one of the factors when determining your search engine rankings. You can use PageSpeed Insights to measure the page load time for any URL.\n\nYou should aim for a score of 90/100 and lower. It\u2019s worth pointing out that although this factor is being used as a ranking factor, a slow site will have a negative impact on user experience, which in turn will affect your brand image, search results, and conversions.\n\n2. Enable GZIP compression\n\nGZIP compression compresses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your web pages, which reduces the size of those files and the total data transferred to the user. Google uses this factor to determine page load time.\n\nPageSpeed Insights has a compression test that allows you to measure the level of compression achieved by your website.\n\nFor more information on how to enable GZIP compression, see this article.\n\n3. Enable HTTPS\n\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) allows websites to tell browsers to avoid interacting with any sites except the ones that use HTTPS. This is useful in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nAs of this writing, Google considers HTTPS as a ranking factor in its search algorithm.\n\nThe problem is that although enabling HTTPS is pretty easy (for WordPress websites), it\u2019s not so easy when you have to replace all of your URLs with HTTPS URLs, and make sure that your backlinks are using HTTPS.\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to migrate, you can use the free tool from CloudFlare, which allows you to encrypt your WordPress website and even apply SSL to all of your images, making the switch to HTTPS easy and effective.\n\n4. Check your internal links\n\nInternal links are links that point to another page on your own website. Google uses these links to determine the value of the pages in your website, and how well your site is structured.\n\nLink-building specialists will tell you that there are a lot of ways to build good quality links.\n\nFor example, you can use social bookmarking sites, forums, and blogs. For links pointing to your website, you can ask friends, relatives, clients, and business partners to post links to your website on their websites.\n\nBut, you should do this within reason, and avoid looking like a link-building spammer.\n\n5. Include internal links in your blog posts\n\nYour blog posts should include internal links, to ensure that Google can detect the relationships between your posts. This will also improve your readers\u2019 experience by allowing them to quickly find the posts that are most relevant to them.\n\n6. Create an XML sitemap\n\nAn XML sitemap is a page on your website that contains a list of all the URLs on your website. If you\u2019ve been blogging for some time, you\u2019ve probably already created a sitemap to allow search engines to crawl your site.\n\nThe problem is that search engines do not use the sitemap file on your website to crawl your website. In other words, sitemap file is useless to search engines.\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a free plugin from Yoast that can automatically generate an XML sitemap and also add the sitemap to your website.\n\n7. Install social sharing plugins\n\nSocial media is a great way to market your website and brand. Not only that, you can also use social media as a way to improve your search engine rankings.\n\nWhen you share your content on social media, you can make the content more accessible to your visitors. Not to mention the fact that social sharing plugins also provide users with a link to your content, which is great for SEO.\n\nSome of the best social sharing plugins for WordPress websites include Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter.\n\n8. Install and enable W3 Total Cache\n\nW3 Total Cache can greatly improve your website\u2019s load speed by enabling caching for your website\u2019s pages, posts, and images.\n\nYou can read my review of W3 Total Cache to learn more.\n\n9. Install and enable Yoast SEO\n\nYoast SEO allows you to configure your search engine settings for each post and page on your website. It\u2019s the most powerful SEO plugin for WordPress.\n\nFor more information on how to configure Yoast SEO for optimal SEO, see my tutorial on SEO for WordPress.\n\n10. Install and configure Google XML Sitemaps\n\nThis is another free plugin from Google that generates an XML sitemap for your website. This sitemap will allow search engines to crawl your website faster and more efficiently.\n\nIt also helps you to build quality backlinks to your website. The links in the XML sitemap are much stronger than the links in your sitemap file, because they are permanent links.\n\nYou can read more about how to configure Google XML Sitemaps for optimal SEO.\n\n11. Install and enable Google Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics is a free analytics tool from Google that lets you monitor your website\u2019s performance, including the number of visitors you\u2019re getting, where they\u2019re coming from, and what they\u2019re doing on your website.\n\nI have my own tutorial on how to configure Google Analytics for optimal SEO.\n\n12. Install and enable Google Webmaster Tools\n\nWebmaster Tools is another free tool from Google that lets you verify your website and configure a wide range of settings, including your preferred domain, how your website is indexed, what the canonical URLs are, whether you allow Google to crawl dynamic pages, whether you allow web crawlers to follow your links, and whether you allow Google to scan your pages for malware.\n\nWebmaster Tools is especially useful for websites that have a lot of dynamic pages, and pages that are indexed using non-standard URLs.\n\n13. Install and enable Google Analytics by Yoast\n\nGoogle Analytics by Yoast is another free plugin that allows you to synchronize your Google Analytics account with the most popular SEO plugin for WordPress, Yoast SEO.\n\nWith this plugin, you can easily add your Google Analytics tracking code to all your posts, pages, and sidebars, without having to manually add the tracking code for each post.\n\n14. Submit your website to Google\n\nIf you have a new website, you should submit it to Google Webmaster Tools, which will allow Google to index your website and create a site map.\n\n15.

These include retail shoppers who look to Amazon for new toys or appliances, travelers who look to Expedia for airline tickets, and even patients who look to the internet to learn about a disease or find a doctor. This presents unique challenges for brand owners. While brand owners can claim ownership of certain content on their sites and apps, much of the internet is controlled by other entities. This includes social media sites, search engines, content syndicators, content aggregators, and other web sites. A brand owner who does not protect its name and trademarks on these sites risks losing control of its brand online.\n\nIn the past, brand owners who found a third-party using its trademarks or similar trademarks had to prove that the third-party was using the mark in a confusing manner. This required proving that the third-party\u2019s use of the mark was likely to cause confusion in the mind of the average consumer, i.e. that it was likely to be mistaken for the mark of the brand owner. Today, however, that burden of proof is no longer necessary.\n\nA little over one year ago, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided the landmark case of Global-Tech v. eBay, 562 F.3d 982 (9th Cir. 2009). The Global-Tech decision held that a plaintiff can bring a claim against a third-party for cybersquatting by using the new procedures set forth in the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 (\u201cACPA\u201d). Previously, under the ACPA, a brand owner had to prove confusion to make a cybersquatting claim. Under the new regime, the burden has been placed on the third-party to show that its use of a domain name is legitimate.\n\nThe burden shift was the most significant change in the Global-Tech case. Before Global-Tech, a cybersquatting plaintiff had to prove confusion. After Global-Tech, a cybersquatting plaintiff only needs to prove that a defendant has registered a domain name similar to the plaintiff\u2019s mark with bad faith intent to profit.\n\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, \u201cthe ACPA\u2019s [bad faith] requirement means little more than that a domain name registrant must intend to profit from the goodwill associated with the plaintiff\u2019s mark.\u201d\n\nOnce a cybersquatting plaintiff has proven this intent, a plaintiff need only show that it owns a trademark that is similar to the defendant\u2019s domain name in order to prevail on its claim. This is the essence of the burden shift. A plaintiff who successfully proves that the defendant is cybersquatting on a domain name that is similar to its trademark does not need to prove that consumers are being confused. The cybersquatter must show that its use of the domain name is legitimate.\n\nThe Global-Tech case also made it easier for a plaintiff to win a cybersquatting case because of the additional burdens placed on a defendant.\n\nFirst, the Global-Tech case made it harder for a cybersquatting defendant to defend itself on the merits. Before Global-Tech, a defendant could defend a cybersquatting claim by arguing that its use of the domain name was not confusing to consumers. However, after Global-Tech, a defendant can no longer rely on its good faith use of the domain name to show that it is not cybersquatting. Instead, a defendant must show that its use of the mark is legitimate. This has led to claims of cybersquatting where the mark and the domain name are similar, but where there is no evidence that consumers are being confused.\n\nSecond, the Global-Tech case made it easier for a cybersquatting plaintiff to obtain injunctive relief. Traditionally, a cybersquatting plaintiff had to show that it was likely to prevail on its claim in order to obtain an injunction to prevent a defendant from using its domain name. After Global-Tech, a plaintiff need only show that the defendant is likely to profit from its use of the domain name to obtain an injunction. Since an injunction may be obtained before trial, this allows plaintiffs to eliminate the use of their marks by defendants before they can defend their actions in court.\n\nThe Global-Tech case has led to a shift in the burden of proof in cybersquatting cases. This shift has created an environment where cybersquatting cases are becoming more difficult to defend.]" time="2.594"><properties><property name="score" value="0.13550121784210206" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.13550122&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.13550122

release was imminent, but recently, Nintendo has shown an admirable level of restraint. The first week of this month is no different, as there's just a couple of new games on the way to the system's digital store.\n\nComing to North America this week is the sequel to the surprise hit of 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. The platformer has a rich history on the PC and consoles, but this remake proved to be well worth the time spent by the fans. With a new look and modern gameplay, this is certainly worth your time if you haven't played it yet. The Dragon's Trap releases in North America on February 9.\n\nFor our European readers, this week brings us into the dangerous world of SteamWorld Dig 2. While the first game was critically acclaimed and earned quite a bit of love, this sequel looks to improve on the formula by adding a lot more variety and some online multiplayer options. Dig 2 is a bit more than a week away, and will be available on February 9.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, then you'll be happy to know that the Nintendo Switch's Virtual Console service has something new in store for you. For the week of February 13, the Nintendo 64 classic Donkey Kong 64 will be available on the system's store.\n\nAs always, we'll keep an eye on the eShop and update you on new releases if and when they become available.

The device I am testing has a button which, when pressed, will alter the value of something between 1% and 100%. How can I find out what that value is? I know that it's 1% - 100%, but I want to know the value of the device and how it affects the outcome.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nMike\n\nIan Smith You need to identify what it is you are actually measuring.\n\n\n\nAre you measuring the current through a certain circuit?

I'm looking at the values in the actual device rather than the sensor values.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nI guess I'll have to figure out what the resistance is when the motor is not turning and what it is when it is, then identify the variables that affect it.\n\n\n\nAny more ideas would be great.\n\nIan Smith I'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nAh! Well, you've gone and identified the system (stepper motor) and the variables (resistance). Now all you have to do is find out the actual resistance and how it changes when the motor is turned.\n\n\n\nAlso, have you determined whether the motor is powered from an AC mains supply or from a DC battery (or similar)? You need to know this because AC mains supplies may vary the current they provide, depending on the load (which may include the motor), and some DC supplies may have a current limit (which you may need to bypass if it's too low).\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMikeJackness Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\nIan Smith Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\n\n\n1. Both, to begin with. You may only need one, but you may need two, and it's better to have two of them.\n\n\n\n2. As above. If you can't build the current measurement, then either use one of the basic models that has a current setting, or use the voltage reading on the meter and then calculate the current from that. (e.g. multiply by 0.6 to get approximate amperes)\n\n\n\n3. Again, as above. If you can't build a current measurement, then you can get a panel meter to do the job for you, or you can try one of the fancier meters that have current measurement as one of their functions.\n\nMikeJackness Thanks for the replies.

Hyland has developed his own approach, based on a number of leading methods, to show the student how to apply them to language use. Divided into four parts, this book explores the key concepts, applications and findings of these methods, in the first section looking at language and discourse as a unit, in the second examining patterns of text structure, in the third explaining how discourse is used to construct particular kinds of meaning, and in the fourth looking at how we study discourse. The first three sections introduce three different approaches to discourse analysis - the macro-structural approaches of Saussure and Gee, the micro-structural approach of Halliday, and the interpersonal approaches of Brown and Hodge. The last section explores ways in which different kinds of discourse are studied, including conversation, literature, power, work and the media. What I liked: This is an excellent textbook. It provides a good survey of a range of discourses analysis approaches and provides clear descriptions of the methodological principles of these approaches. This is an approachable introduction to a complex and diverse field. The topics covered include the analysis of conversation, text and the various modes of literature. Hyland shows how the same principles can be applied to these different types of text. He draws on a wide range of literature to show how discourses can be studied and includes many examples of actual texts. The book is very clearly written, contains many well-chosen examples, and provides a good introduction to a subject which is likely to be of increasing interest to Linguists. What I didn't like: The chapter on the analysis of conversation and the chapter on the analysis of discourse in fictional texts would benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the key concepts used in this type of analysis. For example, the chapter on conversation provides an excellent introduction to this type of discourse, but it would be better if there was a clearer discussion of the concepts of turn-taking and overlap, and a more careful explanation of the use of 'look-back' studies and the main types of transcription. The chapter on discourse in fictional texts provides an introduction to a type of analysis which has not been covered elsewhere in the book, and this is an important addition to the text. However, this chapter does not include the discussion of the key concepts of discourse analysis which is provided in the other chapters. It would have been better if this chapter could have followed the same format as the other chapters, and discussed how a particular approach was developed, what its key concepts are, and how these concepts can be applied. I think that this is an important addition to the book. Another minor point is that there are several typos in the book, but I don't think that this detracts from the overall quality of the book. What is missing: A discussion of the key concepts of discourse analysis which can be applied to all types of text.]" time="1.834"><properties><property name="score" value="0.499798446893692" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Home Articles &amp; Publications\n\nHOME ARTICLES &amp; PUBLICATIONS\n\nFind out more about the Ark Community Foundation and our many achievements here.\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nWHAT'S AHEAD\n\nSee what exciting events and programs the Ark Community Foundation is involved in this year!]" time="0.171"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9084698557853699" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[More than 600 students in the CSU system are waiting for their transcripts to be cleared.\n\nTranscripts at CSU campuses are frozen for over 600 students who attended the Pueblo campus last semester, and if they don't complete their credits and final exams, they could lose their scholarships and their seats.\n\nAccording to the CSU-Pueblo website, 615 students have not yet completed their spring semester.

When Lexus first introduced the current ES in 2006, the formula was right. But by 2012, it had become dated. The original ES was slow, thirsty and not very capable. The second generation added power and speed and was the first ES to tow. With the third generation, Lexus has taken that formula one step further and brought in all-wheel drive and a more refined driving experience. But it also kept the old formula.\n\nStyling\n\nThe 2014 Lexus ES shares its looks with the outgoing model and in a way with the new IS sedans as well. So it is a blend of a wedge shape and something more traditional. From some angles, it is vaguely reminiscent of the LFA. Its grille is pronounced, its side character lines are muscular and its curves on the hood and trunk are attractive and not overdone.\n\nIts front end is more Lexus-like than before and its tail is more sedan-like than before. It has a more modern look without being overly aggressive and its design is not overly bland like some of its competitors. It is a good looking sedan but it will be a little too plain for some people.\n\nTruck Trend's 2014 Best Interiors trophy went to the new Lexus ES. It has an attractive dash that has been borrowed from other Lexus models but it is still nice and functional.\n\nTechnology\n\nI was surprised at how good the 2014 ES was.

I ate unhealthily. I went out for food once a week, never paid more than $8 for a plate of rice and 2 pieces of chicken. Other times I ate popcorn and French Fries with my friends while watching movies in the cinema. And as I became an adult, I ate badly and grew fat.\n\nLast year, I decided to change my life. I started to save money, and from that day, I stopped eating cheaply.\n\nHere are some tips I picked up.\n\n1. Choose the cheaper meal of the day\n\nMcDonalds have only 2 types of meals that are cheaper than the rest. These are the McD Snack Meal and McD Value Meals.\n\nThe McD Snack Meal cost RM5.69, which includes a Chicken McSpicy or Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink. The McD Value Meal costs RM8.19, which includes a Big Mac, a McSpicy or a Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink.\n\nBoth meals are cheaper than the other meals that you can buy.\n\nThe cheapest meal of the day in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal.\n\n2. Eat at \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant instead\n\nIn Singapore, McDonalds is known as \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant. And you don\u2019t need to ask \u2018Where is the nearest McDonalds?\u2019, because in Singapore, \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant and McDonalds is the same thing.\n\nIt\u2019s a myth that \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant is more expensive than McDonalds. In fact, most of the meals that are available in McDonalds can be found at \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nThe most expensive meal in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant is the Set Dinner (Veg/Chicken). The meal costs $7.20. The most expensive meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\nAll other meals in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant are cheaper than the other meals in McDonalds.\n\nFor example, the cheapest meal in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant is the Curry Puff. The Curry Puff costs $3.10. The cheapest meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\n3. Eat from 7-Eleven instead\n\nThere are two reasons why I suggest you eat at 7-Eleven instead of McDonalds or \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nThe first reason is, the food at 7-Eleven is almost as good as the food in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nThe second reason is, 7-Eleven sell drinks and fast food cheaper than McDonalds and \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nFor example, I ordered a portion of Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven. I ordered the Mac and Cheese as a take away, because I do not have any microwave in my office.\n\nThe cost of the Mac and Cheese is $3.30. And I bought a Pineapple Juice, which costs $1.30.\n\nThe total cost of my meal is $4.60. The same meal costs $4.79 in McDonalds.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven tastes a bit different from the one that I bought in McDonalds.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that the taste is not as good as the one that I can buy in \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant.\n\nBut it\u2019s true that the cost is almost the same.\n\n4. Avoid eating at the food court\n\nFood courts are expensive. The price of food sold at the food courts are almost the same as the cost of the same meal in a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo I\u2019ll suggest you avoid eating at the food court.\n\n5. Make food at home\n\nI make sure I cook once a day. I try my best to cook healthy meals. And the cost of the food that I make at home is much cheaper than the cost of a fast food meal.\n\n6. Eat with other people\n\nThe total cost of my meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal.\n\nFor example, I shared a Big Mac meal with my friend. The total cost of the meal was $8.20. That\u2019s because the meal cost $4.29 each.\n\nThe cost of the meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal. The cheaper meal is when I eat alone.\n\n7. Share the meal\n\nSometimes I share the meal with my partner. I usually share a meal with my partner once a week. I share the meal because I feel bad that my partner is eating alone while I\u2019m eating with my friends.\n\nIf I share the meal with my partner, the total cost is $4.60.\n\nIf I eat alone, the total cost is $4.79.\n\n8. Always look for a promotion\n\nIn McDonalds, \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant and 7-Eleven, there are always promotions.\n\nFor example, 7-Eleven and \u2018The\u2019 Restaurant sometimes offer discount on their drinks and fast food.\n\nSo I suggest you always look for a promotion before buying a meal.]" time="2.868"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9397337675094605" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[HapWanderlust September 1, 2011, 8:10 pm it's a very interesting product...\n\nAnonymous September 3, 2011, 12:30 am Thanks for the review, very interesting product and its feature seems to be very promising.

We are not only alive, but many of us have access to a wealth of luxury, both intellectual and material, that few of our ancestors would have dreamed of. And we also have access to media that have transformed the world. One of my sons recently discovered the fascinating series \u201cHow the Universe Works\u201d (available on Netflix). This is a television show, with a high-tech production budget, and it is fascinating. It has some of the best images of the stars and planets ever produced, with an engaging story to go with them. The soundtrack alone is amazing. I highly recommend it. But it only works because of our technology, which has the power to tell stories across the globe.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to leave the planet for science to reach you. It\u2019s right there in your living room.\n\nToday I read a story in the paper about a study that examined the safety of exercise and high protein diets. This study was designed to answer a question that most of us have faced at some point: should I cut back on protein? My story pointed out that the study was very small and inconclusive, but the real story is about how we learn about our world and why this study is inconclusive. It is a story that has been repeated again and again. When new information comes out, we all read it with the same kind of judgment that you would apply to a restaurant: is this place worth my time and money? The more of it you eat, the more of it you want to read. When I read the story in the paper, I didn\u2019t try to understand the process by which the authors made their conclusions. Instead, I simply had a gut reaction: was the story worth the cost of the information it contained?\n\nThat is the only real question that matters when we choose what to read. This question is especially important today because there is so much information out there. When the costs of information are low, it becomes much easier to consume, and with this abundance comes the difficulty of choosing what to read. So we focus on our gut. And this is because we have a brain designed to make these kinds of choices, one that is driven by emotional needs, not rational ones. We are not designed to rationally evaluate the content of each article, but instead we are designed to make emotional decisions about what to consume.\n\nThis point was well illustrated by some research done by scientists at the University of Michigan. They had two groups of subjects: one that was told to read a story that was fun and amusing, and one that was told to read a story that was sad. Then they had them make some choices about the food they would eat for the next week. The group that had been reading the sad story ate 25% fewer calories than the group that had been reading the amusing story. Why? Well, they thought that food was a reward, and since they had been unhappy in the experiment, they cut back on the number of rewards that they would give themselves. This is a very rational process, but the very fact that they were not looking at the process that led them to their choice means that it had to be some form of emotional response.\n\nIn this way, we respond to information much like we respond to food. Food provides us with energy and pleasure, so it is important to choose it well. So we think in terms of gut decisions, not because they are the best ones, but because they help us to cope with our lives. Information is also a source of energy and pleasure, and so we choose it as well.\n\nBut while we are creatures that make emotional choices about our food and information, we also have other needs. These are needs that were emphasized by the process of evolution: needs to know about the world and needs to know about ourselves. So when we read articles, or watch television, or go on social media, we need to know whether they provide this type of knowledge as well.\n\nMost of the time we are looking for a story that is interesting, and that will hold our attention. But we also want a story that tells us something about our world. The better the story is, the more likely we are to learn from it. A story about calories and exercise might not be particularly interesting, but it is important for us to know. A story about the stars and planets might be fascinating, but it doesn\u2019t matter if it is a good story or not.\n\nThis is because we need information about our world to survive and to thrive, and we know this to be true because it is encoded in our DNA. Our brains have evolved to help us process the information that we receive, and so it makes sense that we]" time="2.391"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9998087286949158" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Official Download Source - Manufacturer Website\n\nWindows ME, Windows 98\n\nSoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio Driver\n\nThis package supports the following audio controllers:\n\n- SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio - Version 6.0.11.0601c - 5.5 MB]" time="0.196"><properties><property name="score" value="0.8287380337715149" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.82873803&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.82873803

This man is a type of \u201cperformer\u201d, a type that is often put forward in business culture and in the literature of business leadership, and many men admire it and want to be seen as this type of man. It is the man who is never at a loss for words, and always knows exactly what to say, and is a good listener too. He has an instinctive understanding of people\u2019s moods and emotions. He is the man with the plan. He knows what\u2019s going on. He has a direct influence on others. He is never without a list of bullet-points, even if he\u2019s just going into the shop. He\u2019s good at handling pressure and he\u2019s a team player. He is the man who is looked to for a reaction.\n\nYou can call this type of man many different things. I am going to call him a \u201cbusiness executive\u201d, as it is most widely-used, but it is also a term that is rather different from the role of \u201cbusiness leader\u201d, and which I will also address. I am a business executive, and I have been a business executive for as long as I can remember, and I\u2019m a fairly typical example of a business executive. I think that most people reading this will find that it accurately describes at least a few men that they know.\n\nMost men aspire to this particular role. Some men even feel a burning need to play it. They will not be happy or feel satisfied in life unless they are in this particular role. They often judge themselves by it. They have a high level of need and drive to be a business executive.\n\nBeing a business executive is one of the \u201cgood\u201d ways to be a man, it is one of the ways in which men \u201cmake a difference\u201d and \u201chave an impact\u201d. It is also one of the ways in which men achieve \u201crespect\u201d, \u201crespect\u201d being an essential element in most men\u2019s internal lives. Many men do feel that it is through this role that they will achieve respect, in the same way that they might feel that they achieve respect in the rest of their life. They might not be consciously aware of this, and they may have a lot of other reasons for doing what they do, but respect is there, and is an important part of their motivation.\n\nThis type of role is one of the ways in which men achieve success and status. It is also one of the ways in which they can \u201cgain influence\u201d and \u201cchange things\u201d. It is the way that they \u201chelp people\u201d and \u201cchange things\u201d and \u201cmake a difference\u201d. It is the way that men can \u201chave a great career\u201d, and achieve \u201csuccess\u201d, and \u201cbe respected\u201d, and \u201cmake money\u201d.\n\nIt is not necessary to believe that these are the only or even the most important reasons for having a job. In my experience, most people, male and female, care about these things to some degree or other. I am not attempting to persuade anyone that these are \u201cunimportant\u201d things, I am not setting out to denigrate them. But it is important to understand that these are reasons for working. People, both male and female, need these things, and it is to these needs that they often respond when asked why they work.\n\nBusiness executives often find it easy to get good work. Many people are happy to trust their judgement, because they are good at understanding the people around them, and they can provide answers to difficult questions. They often find it easy to get good work, and they may have a number of people to choose from when looking for a new job.\n\nThey often feel that they are \u201cjustified\u201d and \u201chave a right\u201d to be in the position that they are in. They have earned it.\n\nThis type of role is very similar to that of \u201cbusiness leader\u201d, but these are very different roles. Many people confuse them, and use them as synonyms, and they are often referred to as such in business literature and the popular media. They are not synonyms. They are two different roles, and their differences can be seen in the relationship of the people around them.\n\nThe business executive is a man who is often very popular and well-liked. He is a man who is often admired. He is often seen as the man to turn to for answers. People come to him to find out what is going on, and to find out what to do. He often knows what to say, and he has an instinctive understanding of people\u2019s moods and emotions, and a quick and accurate understanding of the situations that he is faced with. He is a man who is often used by other people as a sounding-board, as a person to talk things over with, as a man to provide feedback and reaction.\n\nBut this is often not the case with the business leader. He often gets into trouble with the people around him, and he often gets an awkward response to his advice. He is not often looked to for feedback or reactions. He often does not feel that he has the understanding that he wants, and that he needs, and that he feels he deserves. He often feels that he is not looked to as much as he would like, and that people would turn to someone else if he were not there.\n\nThis type of role is the most important in a business organisation.

And for many, if not most, men it is not a role that they can play well.\n\nFor many men, playing this role will lead them into unhappiness. They will feel frustrated and unhappy, and it is often a role that causes men to turn against the organisation that they are working for.\n\nMany men who try to be business executives will often find themselves in a difficult situation. Many men will find that they are working for organisations that do not have a business executive position.

For the status effect, see Poison\n\nFor the Hunter creature, see King black dragon\n\nVenom is a poisonous status effect inflicted by many creatures, and is inflicted by the dragon dagger special move. It deals low damage over time, reducing the player's defence level, and decreasing the effectiveness of protection prayers and similar effects. There is no venom available as a spell in RuneScape.\n\nWhen venom is applied, a timer of 16 seconds begins and the afflicted player receives the message &quot;You are beginning to feel venomous!&quot; This timer can be frozen using either an antipoison, or an antifire potion if the dragon dagger special attack is used against the player.\n\nContents show]\n\nSigns and symptoms Edit\n\nIf you get hit by poison, you may notice the following symptoms:\n\nInability to eat while venom is active (unless the player is using food that heals life points only)\n\nInability to cure poison with antipoison or heal poison using poison cures whilst the venom is active (unless the player is using antipoisons or super antipoisons)\n\nA decrease in defence level\n\nVenom damage Edit\n\nPoison has a poison damage value of 10 + 4 * n {\\displaystyle 10+4*n} , where n {\\displaystyle n} is the number of hits received. This means that the average damage of a venom hit is 22.5% higher than the hit's base damage. The maximum poison damage is 120 + 10 * n {\\displaystyle 120+10*n} , which occurs when the player is hit 16 times by venom.\n\nAs with other damage over time effects, poison damage is not affected by damage modifiers or protection prayers.\n\nResistance Edit\n\nThe player's resistance to venom is related to the player's Defence level, and reduces the damage done by venom accordingly. A player with level 90 Defence or higher will be almost immune to the venom of most dragons, while those with a lower Defence level will take considerable damage from even low-level dragons. The dragon dagger's special attack provides temporary immunity to poison from venom, however this immunity is lost when the dagger's special attack is used up, or if the player unequips the dagger.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nEven though the Venom poison effect was not in RuneScape Classic, a poisoned player would say the same thing: &quot;I feel a little woozy...&quot;]" time="1.226"><properties><property name="score" value="0.46894729137420654" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.46894729&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.46894729

It is not because we have an axe to grind, it is because the opposition have an axe to grind. But it does not pass the ACCC test, and it is interesting that they do not want to have that detailed examination of their proposal.\n\nLet us have a look at what Telstra said yesterday. The headline, of course, in the Australian Financial Review is \u2018Telstra asks regulator to speed up broadband overhaul\u2019.

But if you had done your job in the last election and had produced your plan, then the ACCC would have had the option to have you examine your plan and to determine what the rates should be and whether they could be extended. What we have done is ensure that the interest of consumers and business in this country are protected. We have done it by putting in a position where the ACCC will have the opportunity to examine any privatisation proposal that the opposition has.\n\nAnd, Mr President, there are a number of aspects of Telstra that have been raised by the opposition.

He described them as &quot;friends&quot; who had &quot;brought calm&quot; to the region.\n\n&quot;This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil,&quot; Trump said, according to a White House pool report. &quot;If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing, then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil.&quot;\n\nIt's an evolution for Trump, who had attacked the trio of Middle East leaders during the campaign and, after he won, avoided being too complimentary about them.\n\nAnd in the days before his speech, Trump had been on the attack again against Qatar. He had bashed the Gulf country in a series of tweets for alleged &quot;funding of terrorism,&quot; which triggered the diplomatic rift. Trump went to Saudi Arabia on his first trip abroad as President.\n\nTrump has backed the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar and threatened &quot;severe punishment&quot; against Doha for its alleged &quot;sponsorship of terrorism,&quot; according to a Qatari official who spoke with CNN.\n\nTrump's comments about Salman and Faisal came just after he spoke about the Iran nuclear deal. Trump said it was an &quot;embarrassment to the United States&quot; and called it &quot;one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.&quot;\n\nIt is also not the first time Trump has praised King Salman. After his inauguration, Trump made a phone call to the king. He called him a &quot;very wise person who wants to see things get much better rapidly&quot; and called their relationship &quot;extremely good.&quot;\n\nKing Salman was the first world leader to speak to Trump after he was inaugurated, and Salman joined Trump in a visit to a home in Riyadh that was built for families of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US.\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Faisal was assassinated in 1975.\n\nBut despite that history, Trump has only been complimentary about the Saudis, but not in the way some have accused him of being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Saudis helped him create the first page in his Middle East policy.\n\nHe praised the Saudis after he won the election, saying, &quot;Saudi Arabia and I get along great.&quot; He had spoken about it as a campaign issue, saying in March 2016 that he &quot;would like to protect Saudi Arabia&quot; but that the country is &quot;going to have to help us economically&quot; in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTrump had also said in December 2015 that he was against the &quot;concept of bombing&quot; and was for a strong intelligence-gathering effort instead. He said then, &quot;It is a mistake to bomb the oil fields. You bomb the oil fields, you kill civilians, you destroy the oil fields. They are going to get into something else. They are going to produce and sell it someplace else. It will not be a pretty picture.&quot;\n\nAt the time, Trump was being accused of being naive about the region and for giving a nod to terrorists when he questioned whether the US should be spending money and lives to intervene in Syria.\n\nTrump has been criticized for appearing to blame Qatar for the current state of affairs in the region. Some, like the U.S. ambassador to Qatar, have said Trump is trying to improve ties with Qatar in order to fight terrorism.\n\nTrump also spoke during his visit to Saudi Arabia about his support for the monarchy.\n\n&quot;We are not here to lecture. We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership, based on shared interests and values,&quot; Trump said. &quot;We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship.

On Saturday, Danny Garcia and Robert Guerrero will be fighting in the co-main event of the Alvarez-Kovalev undercard, and they are both in the top five of my pound-for-pound list. The winner of this fight will be the mandatory challenger to Keith Thurman for the WBC welterweight title.\n\nThis fight is just one example of how competitive boxing has been in recent years. There are so many great fighters that we could have one of the best years in boxing in recent memory. But before we go any further, let\u2019s take a look at the four fights that were announced this past week.\n\nFor Alvarez-Kovalev, it was the best fight that could have been made at this time in boxing. In the beginning of 2015, the year started off great with Miguel Cotto vs. Canelo Alvarez, which was supposed to be one of the best fights of the year. But instead, it was a non-event and was a flop. Both fighters looked bad, and the fans were disappointed. That being said, the promoters realized that Cotto vs. Alvarez II would not do great numbers, so a rematch was out of the question.\n\nWith Cotto leaving Top Rank, there was a gaping hole in the middleweight division. Alvarez wanted to stay at 154 pounds, but the only option for him was to go up to 160 to fight the middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin. But with Golovkin only having one fight in 2016, and the third bout against Martin Murray in March, the timing could not have been any better for this fight.\n\nWhile the fight is taking place in Las Vegas, it should not hurt the Mexican fighter. The best fights involving Mexican fighters in Las Vegas have always been ones where the opponent is big in name and popularity. Alvarez has already faced Floyd Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Alfredo Angulo, James Kirkland and Miguel Cotto. He has had two pay-per-view fights in Las Vegas, and he has never been hurt by the size of the city or venue.\n\nAlvarez is favored to win this fight, but that could all change if he loses to Golovkin. For those that don\u2019t know, boxing fans can be ruthless, and one loss can change everything. But in the end, the fans and the boxing industry will be the biggest winners in this fight.\n\nThen we move on to Lomachenko vs. Walters. These two fighters have two of the most awkward and beautiful styles in boxing. With Lomachenko being at 122, and Walters being at 130, this is a fight that could not be missed. Walters will be giving up eight pounds to the Ukrainian, but that is not a huge factor in this fight. Lomachenko is only about 1.5 inches shorter than Walters, and he is naturally taller.\n\nThe big difference between these two fighters is the lack of power by Walters. He has knocked out 34 out of his 35 opponents, but his most recent fight was against IBF super featherweight champion Miguel Berchelt. Walters could not KO Berchelt, and he lost a 12-round decision. Walters does not have a huge knockout percentage, and Lomachenko does not get knocked out. So it will be interesting to see how this fight plays out.\n\nThe fight that I am looking forward to the most is Garcia vs. Guerrero. These two fighters are very competitive in their division, and they are both in their prime. Garcia has already had two losses this year, but they were to Shawn Porter and Keith Thurman. Those two fights were competitive and competitive in style. But Garcia showed heart and talent in both of those fights.\n\nGuerrero is coming off of a very exciting win over Andre Berto in November. He was hurt several times in the fight, but he pulled out a split decision. Garcia is coming off of a draw with Porter in March, and he is currently ranked No. 3 by the WBC. While Guerrero is ranked No. 4, he has the ability to beat Garcia. Both fighters are fairly similar in style, and if Garcia is smart, he will win this fight.\n\nThe last fight is a big one: Nicholas Walters vs. Vasyl Lomachenko. I am hoping that this fight does not happen until 2018. The reason is because Lomachenko has a fight with Guillermo Rigondeaux on Dec. 9, and Walters is fighting in March. I want to see both fighters in top condition in this fight. With a possible date of April 28, 2018, it will give the fighters plenty of time to prepare.\n\nI believe that this fight could possibly happen before the end of the year. With Walters fighting on March 4 against Jason Sosa, and Lomachenko fighting on Dec. 9, it could set up this fight for the end of the year. Both fighters are on HBO, and the boxing industry will be happy if this fight takes place. Walters has already fought Lomachenko once in 2013, and Lomachenko is undefeated since that fight.\n\nThe only fight that I am looking forward to more than this one is GGG vs. Alvarez. But this is the second most anticipated fight of the year for me. Walters has proven that he can fight great fighters, but he has not faced anyone that could compare to Lomachenko. Walters was supposed to fight Miguel Marriaga on Nov. 26, but it was cancelled due to his weight.\n\nFor Lomachenko, he has had two tough fights against Guillermo Rigondeaux and Jason Sosa, and they have both been challenging fights for him. Lomachenko has fought great fighters such as Nicholas Walters, Gary Russell Jr., and Orlando Salido]" time="3.157"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9973254799842834" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Self Portrait was a virtual representation of one of Ratonhnhak\xe9:ton's genetic memories, relived by Desmond Miles in 2012 through the Animus.\n\nContents show]\n\nDescription Edit\n\nRatonhnhak\xe9:ton was getting dressed when he heard the sound of barking.

I didn't know what to expect, but it blew me away. As I was preparing to sit down with Richard Linklater to discuss his new film, I had that same feeling. How do you get an audience to empathize with characters they would normally write off as deplorable, if not outright despicable? We talked about this and more, along with the film's complex themes, which Linklater and his actors spent years developing. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nHugh: So what I'm really curious about, it's a little bit about tone. The last scene is going to be one of the most talked about, but there are lots of moments in the film where I don't think it's going to be easy to laugh. We're going to laugh, but it's going to be a complicated laugh. I want to know how you feel about that scene, and the importance of it being there, and what else is going to be the most talked about scene for people?\n\nRichard: You know what, I don't have a clue. I had a couple of moments. You know, I don't think it's anything like the rape scene. You know, that was one that everybody seemed to feel like the first time they saw it, at least in the audience screenings, there was a palpable kind of, &quot;Oh my god.&quot; But the bowling alley thing, we went through a couple of different iterations of it, and I thought the kids were just going to keep on throwing stuff at him, and he'd get up and leave, but no, that was the one that made people in the audience just go, &quot;I can't.&quot; I mean, I remember, I just think of, I have to confess that I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I remember some of the testing, because the movie tested a lot. And they always give you these cards, like &quot;what scene did you love, what scene did you hate,&quot; or whatever, and I was shocked by some of the things that people found totally inconsequential. You know, the whole detention room scene was almost universally praised. They loved that, they thought that was great, and the end of it, not so much.\n\nHugh: Yeah. The thing that's different about this film, obviously, is it's not only looking at people and their humanness. It's also looking at their flaws. I mean, you could write these guys off as total scumbags, but it's also very clear that they're young, and they're just trying to find their way. And that's what makes this so powerful.\n\nRichard: That was very intentional, and the fact that I had kids in the film, that was a choice that I made very consciously, because I wanted to get the perspective of the younger people who are looking at the world for the first time. And, you know, they don't have the same values that we do. They're different, and they don't realize it, but they are. They haven't been tested yet. And they're also kind of looking at, you know, maybe the judgmental generation that they have to become. So it was very conscious.\n\nHugh: So you're interested in their stories. What about the parents? I mean, you're going to be a parent soon, how has that changed the way you look at this film and the stories?\n\nRichard: I think it's made me even more interested in getting the stories right of the younger people, and being as honest as I can with them. I mean, I've thought about, I want to do a prequel, you know, like set in the '70s. I've thought about doing one that goes into the '90s, and then just getting closer and closer and closer to what it's like today, but really starting in the '70s and the '80s.\n\nHugh: It's a very complicated thing, and I know you've talked about this a lot, I mean, this idea of nostalgia. But I feel like there's a particular version of nostalgia that goes with this film. You know, you look at the sort of deep Americana in the film. I mean, how do you feel about that?\n\nRichard: Well, I guess I don't really know what you mean by that.\n\nHugh: It's this kind of very rich Americana that really looks at what life was like before people moved to the suburbs.\n\nRichard: Well, that was intentional, that was sort of the style of the film, but there were a lot of choices in the film, you know, that were very deliberate, and one was to make it as realistic as possible. You know, there was no comedy, there was no satire. I mean, it was really the intention, and one of the ideas that we were talking about was, how can you really make people identify with these people, if they're like, I mean, just people would say, &quot;Oh, they're just total scumbags,&quot; and that's not the intention. You know, it's like, how can you make people feel like this is a reality, and it's not a joke? And I guess that was one of the choices, you know, like that was just something that was a choice that we were very intentional about.\n\nHugh: What about you? How much do you want this film to be like the experience you remember, and how much do you want to add your own personal story into it?\n\nRichard: You know, I guess, I can remember the moment, it's hard to put into words, but it was, it was a really, it was a weird thing, I was in high school, and we were supposed to be staying at this place, and I was going to walk there. And I was, it was very late, it was like, after 10:00 at night, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I was like, you know, what the hell, you know? And I started walking, and I started walking, and I ended up in my bed, but I just had this sense of loneliness and alienation that I can't describe, but it was a very, it's kind of hard to put into words.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: So I think that's one of the things that was in the film, that's in all my films, but I think that was something that maybe people don't talk about. But it's, you know, the great teenage angst, that's like a rite of passage, you know, and I guess that was one of the ideas. I think that's what you mean by kind of a different nostalgia.\n\nHugh: Yeah, but I also wonder if it's almost more... It's like an explanation of the parents, of why they are who they are. You know, because I feel like, I mean, you're an independent filmmaker. You're not making a studio movie, but a lot of these people are making that decision because it's a career, but it's also that they're really starting to question their parents.\n\nRichard: That's a good point. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's probably true. But I'm not sure that the same characters would make the same choices. You know, it's a little bit different.\n\nHugh: That's true.\n\nRichard: So I mean, I guess there's probably a different way of looking at it, but I'm not sure.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: But that's probably true.\n\nHugh: One of the other things that I think is so powerful about the movie, is you can't really tell that they're all the same age.\n\nRichard: Right.\n\nHugh: You know, I think a lot of the time, especially in independent movies, you really can't, especially with characters who are supposed to be that age. But you really do a great job of putting that in there.\n\nRichard: You know, that was a real choice. The only choice that we did was when the girls are taking their bikini tops off, we did make them a little bit older than the guys, because the guys, they were mostly 18, and the girls, you know, they were 21, and they wanted to look that way, you know.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: I didn't want to deal with, you know, the issue of kids playing these kinds of roles, you know.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: So, you know, that was one of the choices that we made, but other than that, you know, that was a choice that we made.\n\nHugh: You know, I can't help but think of the movies that inspired this.

In addition to two sequels and several handheld spin-offs, the series also has an animated movie called Dead Space: Aftermath which was released in 2011. The movie is set between the events of Dead Space and Dead Space 2.\n\nThis week, we're looking at the movie's trailer and comparing it to its source material. I've played through the game and watched the movie and will be judging the trailer based on what was included in the movie. I'll only be judging the first 30 seconds of the trailer to get an idea of what to expect from the whole movie.\n\nThe trailer starts with a shot of the U.S.G Ishimura, the ship from Dead Space. In the game, the ship is overrun by the necromorphs and infested with scary creatures. The Ishimura's distress beacon is flashing, indicating it's under attack. However, the ship looks too clean to be infested. It's not enough to see the ship itself, you would have to see the dead bodies and monsters crawling around to get the idea.\n\nNext, we see a number of humans fleeing from something off-screen. In the game, they would be running from the necromorphs that have overrun the Ishimura. Unfortunately, they're all human beings in a space suit. You'd have to be pretty stupid to mistake that for the necromorphs. Plus, there's no one attacking the humans. In the game, there would be an endless amount of monsters chasing after the players. There wouldn't be a calm look to everything.\n\nThe next shot shows an exterior shot of the Ishimura while the camera rotates around it. Again, it's too clean to be infested.\n\nNext, we see a shot of some characters, all looking shocked. Again, there's no reason for this if it's not an infestation. It's a bit like seeing a normal-looking family in a horror movie. No one is scared. In fact, there's no real reason for them to be on the Ishimura, which is supposed to be an extremely dangerous place.\n\nThe next shot shows the captain of the Ishimura, Gibb, running up a long ramp. In the game, the Ishimura is more like a battle station than a ship, so the captain would be in the control room. We then see someone telling Gibb to &quot;get everyone out of here.&quot; This person has to be an important character from the game or a secondary character. But I'm guessing the person is Gibb's secretary. Again, there's no one yelling or crying. In fact, it seems like the only reason for them to be running around is because it's time to leave.\n\nThe last shot shows the Ishimura firing on something. It looks like they're firing at something, but it's a small target in the distance. The characters aren't running around like it's an emergency. It doesn't look like they're fighting a desperate battle. In fact, the trailer is too clean. All of the shots look like they were taken in a clean studio, not the remains of a space station.]" time="1.570"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997942646344503" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[It is possible that you may not want your users to have the ability to make certain changes to the data that is being tracked. For example, you may want to track a list of servers, but you don't want your users to be able to add servers, remove servers, or make any other changes to the server list.\n\nThe answer to this problem is to use triggers. You can create triggers that run when a particular type of change is made to the data, and it is possible to make these triggers prevent the data from being changed.\n\nTo create a trigger, you can use the command-line function sqlt. For example, you could write a trigger that prevents a user from removing a particular field from the database.\n\nHere is an example of how you might create a trigger that prevents a user from removing the server_name field from the list of servers:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo CREATE TABLE ListOfServers(name TEXT); CREATE TABLE ListOfIPAddresses(ip_address TEXT); CREATE TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers FOR DELETE AS BEGIN RAISE INFO 'You may not delete the field server_name'; END; SELECT * FROM ListOfServers; name ---------- nameserver1 nameserver2 name ---------- nameserver1 name ---------- nameserver2\n\nThe SQL statement you would use to drop the trigger would look like this:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo DROP TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers; DROP TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers;\n\nNotice that we used the same SQL statement to create and drop the trigger. This is a powerful feature of SQL, which allows you to control exactly when a particular change will occur.\n\nFor example, if you want to remove the server_name field from the database, but you want to retain the data that has already been entered, you could write the trigger as follows:\n\nCREATE TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers FOR DELETE AS BEGIN RAISE INFO 'You may not delete the field server_name'; IF (@old.server_name &lt;&gt; @new.server_name) BEGIN INSERT INTO ListOfIPAddresses VALUES (@old.server_name, NULL); UPDATE ListOfServers SET server_name = NULL WHERE server_name = @old.server_name; END; END;\n\nYou would then delete the field, as follows:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo DELETE server_name FROM ListOfServers; DELETE server_name FROM ListOfServers;\n\nThis example uses the triggers to prevent data from being deleted, but you can use triggers to make other changes as well. You can use the following table to help you determine which commands should be used to insert and delete information:\n\nSQL Command Insert Insert into table Insert into table columns Update Update table Update table columns Delete Delete table Delete table columns]" time="1.771"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9947806596755981" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[http://www.stangtv.com/shopping/listing.aspx?itemid=5806&amp;catid=1314\n\n\n\nMy brother just bought this last night and said it is very nice.

But this year, things were different. In Apex 2017, he was defeated for the first time since 2015, eliminated in pools by a man that he once conquered: Samuel \u2018Dabuz\u2019 Buzby.\n\nThe question on the minds of many Smash fans was: Why did Dabuz defeat ZeRo, the player who has never been beaten in this game in tournament?\n\nWell, according to Dabuz himself, it was a relatively simple answer.\n\n\u201cI can speak for myself, but one thing that I have definitely noticed is I\u2019ve been playing with a controller for longer,\u201d Dabuz said. \u201cI was playing a lot with the Gamecube controller in 2012 and 2013, and he was mainly playing with the Wii U controller. That\u2019s a big thing, and I think that in general I know how to read his tendencies a little bit better.\u201d\n\nThe controller is a big factor because of the way that Smash for Wii U is played. Because the game was released on the Wii U, it is not played with a controller that has buttons like the PS4 controller, but rather a gamepad with a touchscreen.\n\nZeRo plays with a Gamecube controller with his right hand on the directional pad, and his left hand on the A and B buttons. Because of this, he has to learn the way he plays on that controller and how to switch to it from a standard Wii U gamepad. Dabuz, on the other hand, is more used to the standard controller, which requires more precision and speed to accomplish the same things.\n\nDabuz and ZeRo also play in different regions, which are played on different stages. For example, Dabuz plays on the East Coast, which has the Dream Land stage. This stage is the most neutral stage, and a player who has grown up on that stage would have an edge on a player who was more familiar with the other stages in the game.\n\nZeRo, on the other hand, plays on the West Coast, where the counterpick stages are often Dream Land 64 and Smashville. These stages can change the way a player plays, especially the super defensive style that ZeRo often employs.\n\nThere are also a few other things that can throw a player off their game, including the noises of the crowd and the pressure of being at the top. In a tournament where every person is trying to eliminate you, it can cause even the best to have a momentary lapse in focus and lose a match they should have won.\n\nThese are all things that have affected ZeRo, but they are things that he can get past. Because he is the best, the biggest target and a huge crowd favorite, it is unlikely that the crowd will stop cheering for him any time soon. And when he has a momentary lapse in focus, his playstyle is based around having more than one good option, and his tech skill is such that he can often do something even when he isn\u2019t at his best.\n\nZeRo will be at CEO next week, and this is his chance to reclaim his title as best in the world.\n\nCover photo by Robert Paul via Twitter]" time="1.729"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997847278912863" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[by Vincent\n\nOnePlus has officially released the Open Beta version of Android 9.0 Pie for the OnePlus 6.

Egli viene da una nobile famiglia e si laurea in teologia presso l\u2019universit\xe0 di Parigi, dove acquisisce una grande dottrina.\n\nIn seguito egli torna alla sua citt\xe0 natale per occuparsi dei suoi affari, ma anche per prendersi cura dei suoi parrocchiani. Viene chiamato a prendere le redini del suo vescovado, allorch\xe9 il precedente vescovo, eletto da Carlo Magno, viene accusato di simonia.\n\nIl vescovo Sisto diviene il successore del suo predecessore dopo esser stato eletto nel 1074. Sotto la sua guida il vescovado cresce e prospera notevolmente.\n\nLa dimostrazione pi\xf9 evidente di questo successo \xe8 la costruzione dell\u2019Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto di Heidenheim, la cui costruzione ha inizio nel 1079, quando Sisto \xe8 vescovo, e termina nel 1092, quando cessa le sue funzioni come vescovo.\n\nAncora oggi si pu\xf2 ammirare questo famoso edificio lungo la strada che va da Heidenheim a N\xf6rdlingen. La sua lunghezza \xe8 di una trentina di chilometri, e il suo diametro di cinque metri.\n\nGli spunti di tale opera li ebbe il vescovo Sisto da tre guerre che furono combattute durante i suoi anni di vescovado, e che hanno luogo, la prima, nell\u2019anno 1077 contro i Tedeschi, la seconda, contro i Bavari nel 1085, e la terza, ancora contro i Bavari, ma questa volta per la conquista della citt\xe0 di Bisanz nel 1092.\n\nIn conseguenza di questi attacchi, il vescovo Sisto fu costretto a rispettare un\u2019astuta tattica militare e ad impiegarla nel campo della politica. Egli fu sempre sul chi vive per quanto riguarda la difesa dei confini del suo territorio.\n\nPer ottenere questo scopo, egli, appoggiato dal vescovo di Bamberga, costru\xec il pi\xf9 grande Aquedotto del suo tempo.\n\nSotto la guida del suo vescovo, il vescovo di Heidenheim, il vescovo di Bamberga ed il vescovo di W\xfcrzburg, si \xe8 provveduto ad avanzare verso i confini nordoccidentali, e i confini dei territori confinanti al nord e ad ovest.\n\nI lavori furono attuati nel campo militare, cos\xec come pure nell\u2019ambito delle arti e delle scienze, perch\xe9 il vescovo Sisto cre\xf2 nel 1078 un\u2019Accademia, a Heidenheim, in cui si studiavano le matematiche e l\u2019astronomia.\n\nIl vescovo Sisto riusc\xec cos\xec a mettere fine alla sua missione e a trasformare Heidenheim in un centro per la conservazione della cultura.\n\nLa costruzione dell\u2019Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto, avvenne attraverso un processo molto interessante. Anche se il vescovo Sisto non costru\xec l\u2019Aquedotto, ma invece lo compr\xf2 e lo espropri\xf2, egli, comunque, ne diresse la costruzione e con questo oper\xec una grande opera.\n\nI lavori dell\u2019Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto avvennero in due diverse fasi. La prima delle quali si ebbe tra l\u2019anno 1079 e l\u2019anno 1084, la seconda, tra l\u2019anno 1085 e il 1092.\n\nI primi lavori iniziarono quando Sisto compr\xf2 e prese in esproprio una quantit\xe0 considerevole di terreno, tra il suo vescovado, e il territorio che allora apparteneva a W\xfcrzburg. In conseguenza di questo acquisto, l\u2019Aquedotto pass\xf2 inoltre da W\xfcrzburg a Heidenheim.\n\nLe trattative che precedettero l\u2019acquisto dell\u2019Aquedotto non furono particolarmente facili, e Sisto si trov\xf2 nelle condizioni di dover impegnare molto denaro e cercare di ottenere il necessario appoggio anche nel campo militare.\n\nSisto, comunque, ebbe la capacit\xe0 di perseguire il suo scopo, e di ottenere il suo Aquedotto, pur non potendo completare l\u2019intero progetto, di cui egli, tuttavia, lavor\xf2 ad un livello rilevante.\n\nL\u2019Aquedotto di Heidenheim \xe8 un monumento per la cultura, e una vera e propria meraviglia, cos\xec come lo fu, quindi, per il suo tempo.

This is how the Uyghurs are, and this is the reason why they fight back, and this is why they do what they do.\n\nFor example, the government forcibly inserts women into the Uyghur\u2019s households and forces them to wear head scarves, it forcibly strips the children from their families and rears them in \u201corphanages,\u201d forcibly rips young girls from their parents\u2019 arms to be sent to Tibet, forcibly controls the number of children Uyghurs are allowed to have, forcibly forces Uyghurs to go to Han villages, forcibly encourages them to go to work in the cities, forcibly puts Han businesses into Uyghur homes, forcibly buys out their livestock and agricultural fields to build industrial parks, forcibly forces Uyghur young people to go to school to study and the rest are to go to do factory work, forcibly builds supermarkets, shops, hotels, etc., which gives them no chance to get employment, forcibly makes it so that Uyghur young people can\u2019t find a spouse to get married and have children, forcibly demolishes their houses and forces them to move to another area, forcibly blocks them from having religious activities, etc., etc., the Uyghurs are continuously being forced to endure.\n\nIf you look at the Uyghur protests from a perspective of someone observing them, you can understand how it all began and why it has continued to this day.\n\nThe government has no choice but to take all this, because the Uyghurs are a minority group with nothing to back them up and their lot is really not the greatest.\n\nOn the other hand, if the government wants to go easy on the Uyghurs, this might also lead to the Uyghurs feeling discontent with the government, so it has to be a careful balancing act.\n\nYou know, because of this constant bickering, the government can no longer help the Uyghurs, because it\u2019s already using all its energy to help the Han, which is what it cares about most.\n\n\u7f51\u6613\u6e56\u5317\u7701\u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u624b\u673a\u7f51\u53cb\uff1a\n\nIf the man really did self-immolate because of the fines, isn\u2019t that a little too extreme?

He was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Sinn F\xe9in.\n\nErskine Hamilton Childers was born in England in 1870, the eldest son of Robert Erskine Childers, a British Army officer and later a writer and political theorist.\n\nIn the course of his lifetime he spelled his surname in a number of different ways, including Childers and Childs.\n\nChilders attended school at Stubbington House, Fareham. At the age of 16 he became a clerk in a Southampton shipping office. He joined the Liberal Party and became a political speaker on its behalf. In 1899 he was elected as a councillor to Southampton County Borough Council.\n\nHe married Molly Zichy-Woinarski (sister of Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Zichy-Woinarski) in 1908, but had no children.\n\nChilders was a keen yachtsman, and in 1906, with Sir Thomas Lipton, he set up the Shamrock IV syndicate to challenge for the Americas Cup.\n\nHe participated in the unsuccessful Irish Convention of 1917\u20131918, a body established by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George which negotiated an agreement with Irish representatives in an attempt to end the period of Irish nationalist insurrection. The Convention, which met at Dublin Castle, made a number of suggestions regarding the governance of Ireland, which were partially incorporated into the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It was Childers, who, in September 1917, raised the need for a &quot;conversation&quot; between Irish and British leaders.\n\nAfter the Easter Rising of 1916, and his arrest for involvement, Childers helped reorganise the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) in an effort to steer it towards constitutional activity and away from militancy.\n\nIn the 1918 general election, Childers stood as a Sinn F\xe9in candidate in Wicklow. Although he did not win the seat, he polled well and the Sinn F\xe9in party decided to nominate him as one of its members of the Irish delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. It was at the Paris Peace Conference that he met Arthur Griffith and became a convinced Irish republican.\n\nHe became a committed supporter of Arthur Griffith's Sinn F\xe9in party. In 1919, he was arrested and charged with sedition, because of his support of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).\n\nHe was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\xe9in Teachta D\xe1la (TD) to the 2nd D\xe1il at the 1921 elections for the Dublin Mid constituency. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, and became a member of the Irish Free State Seanad in 1922.\n\nHe became the fourth President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (i.e. prime minister) in June 1921, and on 26 June 1921 he was appointed to the office of President of the Republic, (which was to become that of President of the Executive Council on the enactment of the 1922 Constitution in August 1922).\n\nIn 1921, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 split the island into two autonomous territories within the United Kingdom: the six north-eastern counties became Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland became Southern Ireland, governed by the Irish Free State government in Dublin. However, the Parliament of Northern Ireland chose to opt out of the Free State in 1922. Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, this meant that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State, but the British refused to accept this, saying it would lead to the &quot;break-up of the United Kingdom&quot;. The Irish Taoiseach and President of the Executive Council (prime minister), W. T. Cosgrave, insisted that the British had breached the Treaty and that the Free State had the right to &quot;withdraw from the British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;, but he chose not to use this option. Instead, he demanded that the Northern Ireland government do so, and thus abolish itself.\n\nChilders was shot dead in his home on Inishmore, Aran Islands, County Galway, in November 1922, two months after becoming President. The following January, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; reported that Michael Noyk, the Russian Consul in Galway, and Joseph Murray, a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, were both implicated in his murder. The paper stated that Murray was sent by James O'Connor to warn Childers to stop political work in the Four Courts or else he would be killed, while Noyk knew of the plot and failed to notify the police. A police officer told the paper that he believed it was an ordinary robbery that &quot;went wrong&quot; as &quot;Childers was too tough a man to be robbed&quot;.\n\n]" time="2.581"><properties><property name="score" value="0.05516829490661621" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.05516829&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.05516829

The paladin is essentially a warrior of the gods, and most spend their lives wandering the world of Oerth, aiding those they deem good or just. Although a paladin will fight to slay a horde of monsters or a mad king, he will not do so out of a lust for battle or destruction, but out of a need to keep the forces of darkness at bay.\n\nPaladins are renowned for their bravery, their unyielding dedication to the principles of good, and their mastery of martial arms. It is rare to find an evil paladin.\n\nAbilities: Strength and Charisma are both prime requisites for a paladin. Strength is his prime requisite, followed by Charisma. Strength governs how hard a paladin can hit, how effectively he can wear armor, and his carrying capacity. Charisma governs the strength of his spells and the DC's of his class skills. A paladin must be lawful good.\n\nHit Die: d10\n\nStarting Age: Complex.\n\nStarting Gold: Complex.\n\nClass Skills\n\nThe paladin's class skills are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).\n\nSkill Points at First Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.\n\nSkill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.\n\nClass Features\n\nAll of the following are class features of the paladin.\n\nWeapon and Armor Proficiency: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).\n\nAura of Good (Ex): The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.\n\nDetect Evil (Sp): At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.\n\nSmite Evil (Su): Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.\n\nIn addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.\n\nThe smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.\n\nDivine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.\n\nLay on Hands (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs one free hand to use this ability.\n\nAlternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.\n\nAura of Courage (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.\n\nDivine Health (Ex): At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.\n\nDivine Bond (Sp): Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.\n\nThe first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch.

It is an essential component in wheeled vehicles, providing a convenient way to deal with irregularities in the road surface.\n\nMost modern vehicles are fitted with some sort of suspension. It is the primary means of isolating the passengers from the road, as well as absorbing the bumps and vibrations from the road.\n\nThe suspension system on a vehicle provides the following functions:\n\nThere are many systems available that provide all or most of these functions, but most can be categorized by their design and motion characteristics.\n\nThe simplest suspension systems are rigid, and often called &quot;hard suspensions&quot;, because they don't use any fluid damping. Instead, they rely entirely on the elasticity of the metal or the springiness of the suspension elements to soak up the bumps. Some early vehicles used torsion springs as suspension, but modern systems almost all use either coil or leaf springs, or shock absorbers.\n\nThe first and simplest suspension system was used by the French inventor of the wheel, Leonardo da Vinci. It consisted of four flexible limbs connected to the carriage. These limbs served as both the suspension and steering system.\n\nIn addition, Leonardo designed a system that included advanced features such as brake linings, bearings and a double-action brake system. A suspension system for cars was introduced by M. Thon in France in 1898. It consisted of a network of rubber bands that took the place of conventional springs. The rubber bands were enclosed in a conventional coil-spring housing. An advantage of this system was its light weight. Thon's design was introduced to the United States by John M. Curtis in 1904.\n\nBy the 1920s, many independent suspension manufacturers were using the pneumatic springing system as the basis of their systems, as well as using rubber or steel cords for springing. The principal disadvantage of the pneumatic system is that the spring-pressure increases with the compression of the suspension. In addition, a system that is not correctly adjusted will not ride well.\n\nThe third kind of suspension system was developed by the Morgan Motor Company, based in the UK. In this system, the spring is attached to the frame, and the shock absorbers are attached to a special hub, which attaches to the front and rear axles. This system is still sometimes seen in modern cars, since it is less expensive than the other systems and in most cases provides an adequate ride. This system has not been popular in Europe and North America since the 1930s.\n\nThe most common suspension system in modern cars, used in everything from Ford Model Ts to the Chevrolet Corvette, is the &quot;independent front suspension&quot;, or &quot;live axle&quot;. In this system, the suspension is a more or less conventional system of springs and shock absorbers, with the additional feature of a locating link (the king pin in an axle-based suspension). This allows the axle to move up and down relative to the chassis. The locating link ends are attached to the car body, which provides the rolling element to the system.\n\nThe other feature of this system is the axle, which provides the pivoting element of the suspension system. The wheel hub is attached to the ends of the axle, and the wheel itself is attached to the hub. The spring system, located in the body of the vehicle, is attached to the axle via the locating link. The body of the car, therefore, provides the &quot;pivot&quot; of the suspension.\n\nA number of variations on this design have been used, most notably independent rear suspension, in which the rear wheels are located by a trailing arm (a form of wishbone) instead of the traditional transverse leaf spring. Another design commonly found on trucks is the &quot;live rear axle&quot;. In this system, the axle is located by an arm from the leaf spring. The rear wheels can move up and down relative to the chassis without any location from the body.\n\nA design commonly used on many racing cars and on some passenger cars is the DeDion or De Dion suspension, named after its inventors, the De Dion brothers. In this system, the two wheels are located by a triangular or &quot;semi-trapezoidal&quot; bar. The pivot is provided by a bearing block mounted to the car body, while the pivoting point for the wheels is a ball joint on the axle.\n\nThe DeDion design is an expensive design, due to the cost of the wheels, brakes and other parts. However, it does provide excellent wheel location, as the wheels can be moved by several inches in any direction without affecting the steering.\n\nRacing cars generally use the DeDion system, as the location of the wheels is the primary function of the suspension system. However, it is also used on a number of sports cars, including the Jaguar XK120, the Maserati 3500 GT and the Lamborghini Gallardo.\n\nOne of the main disadvantages of the DeDion suspension is that the front wheels are not located directly above the chassis, and there is significant scrub radius. For example, a wheelbase of 86\xa0inches (218\xa0cm) on a vehicle with a wheel diameter of 18\xa0inches (46\xa0cm) would produce a scrub radius of around 8\xa0inches (20\xa0cm). This can cause the car to steer and corner differently depending on the tire wear, since the scrub radius is at its largest when the tires are new.\n\nWhile an advantage of the DeDion system is that it is lighter than a comparable design, this is not a major consideration for racing cars. However, since racing cars are generally not driven at high speeds for long distances, the &quot;chassis bounce&quot; caused by the scrub radius is not an issue.\n\nOne of the first types of suspension system was introduced by Earle Crooker and was called &quot;Independent Coil Spring Suspension&quot;. It was a brand name that existed only in the late 1920s. The name was used by C. G. Ames Co.\n\nIn this system, the springs are attached directly to the frame. In this system, the wheel is attached to the axle, which is supported by a bearing attached to the frame, not the car body.\n\nThe primary advantage of this system is the ease with which the wheelbase can be changed. In most cars, the wheels are located by a link that is attached to the axle and the frame, and the wheels can move relative to the car body. In this system, there is a much smaller length change, as the wheels move up and down relative to the axle.\n\nThe disadvantage of this system is that the body is no longer a &quot;pivot point&quot; for the suspension. The body is now part of the suspension system. This makes it very difficult to change the camber of the wheels (i.e., the angle of the wheel relative to the car body). In addition, the wheel can only move in one plane, as the upper control arm and the lower control arm limit the movement of the wheel. The car may need to be aligned more often, as the geometry of the suspension can change more than a suspension system where the wheels move relative to the body.\n\nThis system is commonly found on American cars built in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the Nash Ambassador, Hudson, and other brands. It is less commonly found on European cars, although it was used on some Mercedes-Benz models]" time="3.777"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9658008590340614" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[L\u2019avvento di Zuckerberg ha definitivamente maturato il passaggio dalla televisione tradizionale a quella digitale.

The aim of the project is to help these rough sleepers access the appropriate support services, whether it be residential or non-residential. The campaign highlights the issue of rough sleeping in Dublin city, which is rising at an alarming rate, with an increase of over 40% in the number of people living on the streets since 2013. The campaign\u2019s focus is on raising awareness of this issue.\n\nThe campaign involves advertisements on the city\u2019s LUAS and Dublin Bus, as well as featuring on O\u2019Connell Street, Portobello and Talbot Streets. It also involves the installation of posters across the city, specifically in locations where the homeless are more likely to reside.\n\nSpeaking at the campaign launch, Minister Flanagan said: \u201cRough sleeping has reached record levels and has become a visible problem in our capital city. The launch of this campaign will increase awareness of the services provided by the Crosscare Pathways Project to rough sleepers, so that they are aware of the options available to them. Rough sleepers should be referred to the services that will best suit their needs. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am particularly concerned to ensure that rough sleepers are not penalised for begging and sleeping on the streets.\n\n\u201cThe Government is determined to prevent and reduce homelessness, to support rough sleepers to exit homelessness, and to prevent homelessness for others at risk. Over \u20ac70 million has been provided to support homeless services and prevent homelessness, which includes funding to frontline services such as the Crosscare Pathways Project, who work to prevent rough sleeping by providing outreach support to rough sleepers.\u201d\n\nMinister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar said: \u201cThe \u2018Living On The Streets\u2019 campaign brings home the reality that the street is a harsh and unforgiving place to be, particularly during the winter months.

That is why it is so important that we engage the public, using this campaign as an opportunity to highlight the services available to rough sleepers, including the Crosscare Pathways Project. It is a complex problem that requires a complex response, involving a number of different organisations, as well as a societal change in attitude.\n\n\u201cWith the help of my colleague, Minister Flanagan, we have increased funding for the homeless to \u20ac70 million this year, which will provide more than 3,000 more beds in a wide variety of services.

The first is about healthcare reform in the USA:\n\n\u201cHave you heard about the new Congressional Health Care plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the government\u2019s going to give you half of what it takes away.\u201d\n\nAnd the second, about the NHS:\n\nA man is at the doctor\u2019s office, and the doctor tells him, \u201cI\u2019ve got some good news and some bad news for you.\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t take the bad news right now, so give me the good news first.\u201d\n\nThe doctor says, \u201cWell, the good news is that you have an 18-inch penis.\u201d\n\nThe man looks stunned for a moment, and then asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d\n\nThe doctor says, \u201cYour brain\u2019s in your dick.\u201d\n\nThese jokes may be inaccurate, of course. For example, the doctors\u2019 pay packets are pretty great, and some of them can do much better work in the US than in Britain. But one thing I know is for sure: it\u2019s great to see the NHS getting some serious attention in the American media. I bet it makes the doctors happy.]" time="1.185"><properties><property name="score" value="0.971766471862793" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Hello.\n\nI have been trying to download the RPM of a file that resides on a university FTP server.

I believe that there\u2019s something for everyone to enjoy, as the author does such a great job of portraying the characters in all their strengths and flaws. Sometimes they go a little over the top with the angst, and it isn\u2019t very realistic, but I understand why. There are authors who never experience any type of conflict with their characters, and the books just feel very one dimensional. Some books can have some really crappy endings, but I have learned to stay away from books that end with the couple together and happy but someone was murdered or something along those lines. I don\u2019t care for books that have the couple separated, but they\u2019ll come back together in the end.\n\nWhat I want in a good romance book is a good, if not a great, ending that makes me feel good, no matter what happens to the characters. As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t like books that end in tragedy, and they usually do end in tragedy. There are some that aren\u2019t too tragic, but they just aren\u2019t the endings that I like. This is where the author\u2019s job becomes very difficult. They have to give the reader a reason to feel the way they want them to feel about the characters. If they feel bad, they\u2019ve done their job. If they feel happy, they\u2019ve done their job. As a reader, I\u2019m not looking to be outraged, nor am I looking to be happy. I\u2019m just looking for something that makes me feel.\n\nOn the flip side of that, I know a lot of people don\u2019t want to be emotionally manipulated. They just want to read a book and enjoy it. They don\u2019t want to be forced to feel one way or another. They want to feel neutral. Neutral, to me, is a huge accomplishment in a romance novel. To me, a romance novel has to be able to get a person, even if they don\u2019t think it will, to feel something for the characters. In most books, people want to know how they can make a particular character do what they want them to do. In a romance novel, that\u2019s the main character. They want to know how they can make the characters fall in love, because they see themselves in one or both of them. How would they do it? How would they fix it?\n\nThat is what a reader does when they read a romance novel. They want to know how to fix the problems that the characters have. This is why the ending is so important. It has to make the reader happy, but not to the point where they roll their eyes or feel like they were taken for a ride. I have a great example. In the movie Now and Then, a woman tells her daughter that she is happy. When her daughter tells her that she is, too, she tells her that it\u2019s because they\u2019re both lying. They don\u2019t want to make each other sad, so they\u2019re lying to each other. This is the exact thing that happens in a lot of romance novels, in my opinion. They\u2019re trying to make the readers feel good, but in the process they\u2019re lying. To me, the ending has to make the reader feel what the author was trying to make them feel, not what they want them to feel.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that the book has to end the way I want it to. What I\u2019m saying is that I want the author to be honest. I want them to give me a believable ending that isn\u2019t just thrown together so that they can end the book. I want the ending to mean something, and I think that\u2019s what most readers want. Most people like to be happy, and a good book will give them that. The ending has to be good enough that the reader doesn\u2019t feel like they wasted their time, but also good enough that they\u2019re not completely disappointed. They have to be happy with the story, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly what they wanted.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite romance book endings?]" time="2.172"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997991025447845" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[1) Running on behalf of a person\n\nThese dates are the running dates for campaigns on behalf of clients.

While not naming China, the intended target of that policy was clear. The Chinese government, on the other hand, was not impressed.\n\nWriting in the English-language edition of China Daily on Monday, Ma Kai, vice-premier of the State Council, or China's cabinet, and chair of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), countered the Trump administration's position by arguing that China has been the most open to foreign investment in the world for the past three decades.\n\nIn Ma's view, China is playing by the rules of free trade. The problem is that the rules that America wants are not the same rules that America has been playing by. The United States wants to be able to sell its goods and services into China, but it wants to block Chinese goods and services from being sold in America.\n\nSpecifically, Ma pointed to the issue of the U.S. $347 billion trade deficit with China, which is the focus of a U.S. investigation to determine whether China's government has unfairly subsidized certain industries.\n\nBut China is not subsidizing its industries, according to Ma. The U.S. trade deficit is simply a function of America's industrial overcapacity and under-consumption, as well as Chinese market and regulatory restrictions on certain industries.\n\nIn Ma's view, there is an easy solution to the trade deficit, and that is to allow China to import more agricultural products, textiles, and auto parts from the United States.\n\nThis is not the first time Ma has been forced to explain the Chinese position in the ongoing trade war. Last week, he held an hour-long interview with Charlie Rose, the television host. In the interview, Ma also said that he would not criticize the Trump administration for the position it is taking. Instead, he is simply trying to point out to the Trump administration that it is China that has been working toward a free trade regime, and that the American government has not been as open as the Chinese government has been in allowing Chinese companies to invest in American businesses.\n\nWhat Ma is really doing is not simply trying to engage in a debate about the nature of free trade, but to make sure that Americans understand how the Chinese government is fighting to protect its own economy from the American tariffs, while at the same time, maintaining a narrative of the mutual benefits of free trade.\n\nMa's interview with Charlie Rose can be viewed here:]" time="1.349"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997834165891012" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[WHY PEOPLE KEEP COMING BACK\n\nMany people come back again and again to our Salon.

China has been actively preparing for the summit and has invested in the improvement of its infrastructure and public services. However, the relationship between China and the US has deteriorated in the past few weeks. The US has asked the WTO to look into what it describes as unfair treatment of US companies in China. Furthermore, the EU, the US and Japan have called for retaliatory measures against China, after the announcement of a new Chinese law to allow China to bypass international patents. On the other hand, there are indications that the Chinese government will relax foreign ownership restrictions in its auto industry, and also encourage the outflow of capital from the country. The theme of the summit is &quot;Better Growth, Better World&quot;, and the three themes will be &quot;growth&quot;, &quot;inclusive growth&quot;, and &quot;sustainable growth&quot;.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the World Bank, China has a great economic potential, yet faces severe challenges. These challenges include maintaining the economic growth, the management of urbanisation, the fight against corruption, the increasing inequality and the aging population. On the other hand, the report also concludes that China has the opportunity to become a major contributor to global growth, thanks to the fact that China is an important producer of capital, the country is growing in the manufacturing sector, and is also important in terms of consumption, which is expected to grow by more than 6% this year. The report also highlights the fact that China has been the biggest contributor to the global GDP growth in the last 15 years, with a contribution of 30%.\n\nOn the other hand, China is also a top trading partner of the US, with trade between the two countries amounting to more than $600 billion. Therefore, the potential of a trade war between the US and China would be dramatic. As the leaders of the two countries are gathering in the same city, the G20 summit will be an opportunity to address many of the issues between the two countries. As an example, the summit will discuss the sustainability of trade, both for exports and imports.\n\nIt seems that the US and China may be heading towards a trade war. If such a trade war will occur, it will have devastating consequences on both the US and Chinese economies, as well as on the global economy. Furthermore, the WTO may face a severe problem, as it would probably have to be the court of the two parties involved in the trade war.

He's thrilled to see her finally feeling better, but he can't help but wonder if she's just hiding the fact that she's sicker than ever.\n\nHe can't bring himself to ask.\n\nShe starts working on her first assignment with a new partner a few days later. This new partner's name is Adam, and he seems like a pretty nice guy. Max watches Liz interact with him and can't help but wonder if he's doing the right thing by keeping her away from the wedding business. He knows how much she loves the job, and this is the first time he's seen her truly smile in a while.\n\nOf course, he doesn't get the chance to mention that to her. The moment he opens his mouth, she cuts him off and says she has a date with Adam.\n\nLiz goes on a date with Adam, and comes home late again. Max's heart sinks when she opens the door and he sees the smile on her face. It's not her usual smile, the one she saves for Max. It's the smile she reserves for Chompy and her art, and it's a smile he hasn't seen in a long time.\n\nMax knows what he's supposed to do, and he knows what's best for Liz. He knows that keeping her away from the wedding business is the best thing he can do for her. But he can't bring himself to do it.\n\nHe still isn't sure how she's going to take it when he tells her.\n\n&quot;Oh my god,&quot; she says, and Max's breath catches in his throat.\n\nHe doesn't get a chance to tell her that he's sorry.\n\nShe rushes off the bed and takes the two steps necessary to cross the room. She throws her arms around him, and Max's whole body tenses at the unexpected contact. He can feel her shaking in his arms, and the sound of her sobs echo through his apartment.\n\nShe tells him she loves him, and he tells her that he loves her too. She pulls away, and he can see the tears streaming down her face. She says that she has to go, and he knows he has to tell her what he did.\n\nHe knows she'll be angry with him, and he's not sure how she's going to react.\n\nShe kisses him on the cheek, and then disappears out the door.\n\nHe doesn't go after her.\n\nMax calls Liz the next day, and tells her to come over to his apartment. She's silent the entire drive, and he's not sure what she's going to do when she walks in.\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he says, and she freezes in the middle of the living room.\n\n&quot;I have something to tell you,&quot; he says, &quot;and I'm going to need you to promise me that you'll stay calm.&quot;\n\nShe gives him a slow nod, and he knows she's not going to like what he's about to say.\n\n&quot;I called Hank, and I told him that you were sick. That's why you haven't been going to work. I told him that you needed to take some time off, because you had a really serious case of strep throat.&quot;\n\nShe opens her mouth to say something, but he interrupts her and keeps going.\n\n&quot;He didn't want to believe me at first, but I convinced him. I told him that it wasn't a big deal, but he needs to know if you start showing signs of weakness. He's going to call in a few days to check up on you. I told him you wouldn't answer your phone, and that's why he's calling here instead.&quot;\n\nHe sees the expression on her face, and he knows it's time to tell her the truth.\n\n&quot;You're really sick, aren't you?&quot; she asks.\n\nHe nods.\n\n&quot;How sick?&quot; she asks, and he knows this is the moment he's been dreading.\n\n&quot;Very sick,&quot; he says, &quot;It's Hodgkin's lymphoma. And it's probably already in your lungs.&quot;\n\n&quot;When did you find out?&quot; she asks, and Max can't stand to look at her. He turns away, and he's silent for a few moments.\n\n&quot;I knew as soon as we got home,&quot; he says, and she goes completely still.\n\n&quot;Max,&quot; she says, and he turns around.\n\n&quot;I was afraid,&quot; he says.\n\n&quot;You didn't have any right,&quot; she says, and he can see the tears in her eyes.\n\n&quot;It was a bad idea,&quot; he says, &quot;I know it was a bad idea.&quot;\n\n&quot;What about me?&quot; she asks, and he knows what she's asking.\n\n&quot;You have to promise me that you'll stay out of the wedding business for a while,&quot; he says, &quot;I can't risk you getting hurt.&quot;\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n&quot;You can't stop me from doing this,&quot; she says.\n\n&quot;Liz,&quot; he says, and his voice cracks.\n\n&quot;I'm not giving up on my dream, Max,&quot; she says.\n\n&quot;It's not a dream,&quot; he says, &quot;It's your life. It's your job, and I can't risk you getting hurt.&quot;\n\nShe shakes her head again.\n\n&quot;You can't tell me what to do,&quot; she says.\n\n&quot;I can and I will,&quot; he says.\n\n&quot;We're not a team,&quot; she says, &quot;We're not the Millers.&quot;\n\n&quot;You're not the Miller,&quot; he says.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; she says, &quot;I'm the Keller.&quot;\n\nHe's never seen her like this before, and he realizes she's not going to let him stop her.\n\n&quot;I'm doing this,&quot; she says.\n\n&quot;No, you're not,&quot; he says, and he can see the fire in her eyes.\n\n&quot;Don't tell me no,&quot; she says, &quot;Don't tell me I can't do this.&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm not telling you that,&quot; he says, &quot;You're going to do this, no matter what I say.&quot;\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n&quot;I can't stop you,&quot; he says, &quot;I know I can't.

In particular we consider the following problems: the serial position effect, the order effect, the semantic (in)sensitivity, and the distance effect.\n\nFigure 6.16 shows an example of text results of three sequences of three sentences. The whole process of filling and querying a WBS model is shown in Figure 6.17.\n\nWe can observe that in all three sequences the first sentence (\u201cA citizen of A is driving a car\u201d) is more frequently retrieved than the second sentence (\u201cA citizen of B is driving a car\u201d). The number of retentions for the first sentence is also higher than the number of retrievals for the second sentence, which can be attributed to the lexical and syntactic differences between these two sentences.\n\nAnother common problem in short sentences is the inter-sentence association: if a WBS model is designed to store sentences and not words, then the grammatical order of the sentences is kept in the model. Thus, the sentences that have the same word but a different order in the two sentences will be retrieved as if they had the same word. Figure 6.18 shows an example of sentences with the same words but a different order. As expected, the same sentences will have a higher number of retentions than the same words in the same order.\n\nThe serial position effect can be observed when words that occur in a specific position in the sentences are more retrieved than the same words that occur in different positions. This effect can be attributed to the influence of the semantic context on the recognition of the words that are at the same position in different sentences, and the words that are not in the same position have a different semantic context that makes them not to be recognized as if they were in the same position. Figure 6.19 shows an example of sentences with the same words in the same order but with a different position in each sentence. In this example, the word \u201cof\u201d in the position 5 of the first sentence is more retrieved than the same word in the position 7 of the second sentence, and the word \u201cof\u201d in the position 3 of the second sentence is more retrieved than the same word in the position 6 of the third sentence. This effect is more noticeable when the word \u201cof\u201d is repeated.\n\nIn this section, we present the results of a search on the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) [44] with the retrieved words and their respective sentences in a sentence. For each sentence, the average of the values of the retrieval frequencies for all the words in the sentence is computed.

It was the seventh round of the 2010 Formula One season. The 60-lap race was won by Red Bull driver Mark Webber, after he started from second position. Lewis Hamilton finished second for the McLaren team and Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso came in third.\n\nPirelli's prime tyre compound was the hard &quot;primes&quot;, whilst the option tyre was the soft &quot;option&quot; compound.\n\nMark Webber took pole position for Red Bull, his first since the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix, while Fernando Alonso set the fastest time in Q2 and qualified second. The two Ferraris filled the next row with Felipe Massa ahead of Kimi R\xe4ikk\xf6nen. The two McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button were fifth and sixth, with Nico Rosberg in seventh place, having struggled all weekend with the handling of his Mercedes. Adrian Sutil in the Force India was eighth, followed by Sebastian Vettel in the second Red Bull and Nico H\xfclkenberg in the Williams. Paul di Resta, S\xe9bastien Buemi and Michael Schumacher rounded out the top ten. At the start, Mark Webber led away from Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa while the two McLarens of Hamilton and Jenson Button slipped backwards, with Hamilton eventually being forced to pit with an electrical problem, and Button dropping to eleventh. Mark Webber's race soon went wrong as he came into the pit lane to switch to his wet weather tyres on lap 11, but was told to remain in his pit box as he had not switched off his engine, having forgotten to do so. This meant he was stationary for 23 seconds and dropped to fourth, before recovering to third by the time he rejoined the circuit. He also had to serve a drive-through penalty for passing Alonso on the grass, although he eventually finished fourth.\n\nAlonso and Massa pitted on laps 18 and 22 respectively, rejoining in second and third places behind the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton, who had made an early pit stop for dry tyres and was running a different strategy to the two Ferraris. With the track still wet, Hamilton, Massa and Alonso all switched to the intermediate tyres on lap 25, but at this point, the gap between the top three was only 1.3 seconds. The McLarens of Hamilton and Button were then unable to pass the Ferraris on the drying track and they began to slip backwards, eventually losing their fourth and fifth places to the two Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta. The latter had passed Sutil on the main straight on lap 30 after the Force India driver had made a pit stop and had a clear track in front of him, and held on to fifth place despite being passed by Sutil a few laps later. The two Toro Rossos of Jaime Alguersuari and S\xe9bastien Buemi were the first of the lead lap cars to pit on lap 28, with Alguersuari dropping behind Rosberg in the standings after pitting earlier than the Mercedes driver. The other Toro Rosso of Sebastien Buemi managed to stay out longer and maintained his eighth place, before making a pit stop at the end of lap 34.\n\nFurther back, Jenson Button was the first of the two McLarens to pit for new tyres on lap 33, with a nine-second stop due to an electronics problem with the wheel gun which meant the front left tyre was not fitted correctly. Team-mate Lewis Hamilton followed suit a lap later and rejoined the race in twelfth place. Button rejoined the race behind S\xe9bastien Buemi and passed him on lap 36, but was behind Adrian Sutil when he stopped for fresh tyres on lap 38, although Button was able to pass Sutil a few laps later, with Buemi also getting ahead of the Force India. At the end of the 43rd lap, Lewis Hamilton had managed to pass Paul di Resta and move up to eighth place, with Sutil falling to ninth, having been passed by both Buemi and Button.

Bushmaster was also the head of the ruthless Bushmaster drug cartel.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nNot much is known about John Bushmaster's early life, except that he was once involved in organized crime. He became a drug lord and took over his brother's position as head of Harlem's Paradise. He later became involved in the criminal organization known as the Hand.[1]\n\nLuke Cage's Power\n\n&quot;Tell me where they took Misty Knight.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are you going to do with me?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, I'm not going to let you walk away.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who's going to stop me?&quot;\n\n&quot;Luke Cage.&quot; \u2015Luke Cage and Bushmaster [src]\n\nWhen Bushmaster witnessed Luke Cage throw a man out of Harlem's Paradise for harassing some young women, he asked his brother, Quincy, to help him get rid of the unruly patron. The next day, Bushmaster called the man who was threatening to sue Harlem's Paradise and threatened to kill him. When Cage returned, Bushmaster tried to persuade Cage to leave by telling him he did not belong there. Bushmaster revealed to Cage that his name was John Bushmaster and that he was the owner of Harlem's Paradise. When Cage insisted that he would be staying, Bushmaster noted that he did not know who he was messing with before Cage told him he was messing with Luke Cage.\n\nCage remained in Harlem's Paradise and caused problems for Bushmaster, much to his annoyance. Bushmaster and his men began selling the Bushmaster drug throughout Harlem. Cage overheard Bushmaster's name when it was said by his brother Quincy during a phone call. When Cage visited Bushmaster at Harlem's Paradise and accused him of being behind the Bushmaster drug, he denied it and told Cage to leave. Bushmaster's men, however, confronted Cage and attacked him. Cage easily overpowered all of them and escaped from Harlem's Paradise.[1]\n\nChasing Misty Knight\n\n&quot;I'm getting sick of your bullshit.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is that what you tell all the girls?&quot; \u2015Bushmaster and Misty Knight [src]\n\nWhen Cage attacked one of Bushmaster's drug warehouses and threatened to kill Bushmaster if he did not tell him where he was keeping Misty Knight, Bushmaster told him that he did not know what he was talking about and Cage attacked him. Bushmaster ordered his men to shoot Cage while he escaped. The bullets did nothing to Cage as they could not penetrate his skin.\n\nBushmaster visited Pop's Barber Shop and threatened to burn down Pop's Barber Shop and kill everyone inside if he did not get a haircut, including the young girl named Tilda Johnson, who could do a mean cornrows, before he left. Tilda snuck out of the shop and stole Bushmaster's car while he was inside getting a shave. Bushmaster ran outside and found Tilda attempting to get away. He then chased after Tilda in the stolen car.\n\nTilda was able to evade Bushmaster's pursuit until he was able to push her car off the road and caused her car to roll over and crash. Bushmaster dragged Tilda from her car and found out who she was. Tilda, however, was rescued by a bystander who had witnessed the entire incident and called the police. Bushmaster was arrested for kidnapping, but he was released from police custody later.[2]\n\nBusiness Proposition\n\n&quot;Now, we are making money, yes, but not as much as we should.

It's time for you to grow up.&quot; \u2015Bushmaster and Shades [src]\n\nBack at Harlem's Paradise, Bushmaster offered Shades a percentage of his drug business, but Shades refused. Bushmaster made an offer to Diamondback to sell him some of his product in exchange for a fee. Bushmaster met with Shades, who berated him for not being a better businessman and selling to Diamondback. Shades told Bushmaster that he was selling drugs on his own, but Bushmaster told him that he had a plan to sell his drugs in Bushmaster branded bullets. Bushmaster then attempted to seduce Shades' wife, Tilda Johnson, but she refused his advances.\n\nThe next day, Bushmaster gave a speech to the patrons of Harlem's Paradise as they celebrated the end of their evening. Bushmaster boasted about his power and demanded that they bow to him, but was met with little response. Shades then insulted Bushmaster, who then drew his gun on Shades. Luke Cage then attacked Bushmaster, but Bushmaster managed to get the upper hand and beat Cage into submission. As Bushmaster prepared to shoot Cage, Tilda Johnson shot Bushmaster in the chest with a concealed gun and stole his gun, with Shades shooting the other members of Bushmaster's entourage before they could react.\n\nBushmaster and his men went into hiding at a warehouse, where Bushmaster furiously scolded Shades for his betrayal. Shades explained that he had been working with Diamondback, but now wanted to make a better life for himself and his wife. Bushmaster, realizing that Shades had a point, agreed to go into hiding for the night. The next day, Bushmaster was visited by Knight, Shades, and Cage. Knight had returned to take back Harlem's Paradise. Knight gave Bushmaster a chance to surrender, but Bushmaster refused and attempted to shoot Knight, but was overpowered by Cage and Knight, forcing him to surrender.\n\nWhile Knight and Cage prepared to transport Bushmaster to Ryker's Island, Bushmaster told them that the shipment of drugs would be arriving that night. The police tried to stop the convoy, but the SWAT team was gunned down by Bushmaster's men. Knight decided to attack the warehouse to stop the shipment from getting to New York. Knight, Cage, and Bushmaster fought his men while Tilda Johnson fought Diamondback and his men, although Diamondback managed to escape from the scene.\n\nOnce Knight and Cage subdued the rest of Bushmaster's men, Knight interrogated Bushmaster about where the shipment was. Bushmaster told them that the guns had already been sold to a man named Ricky. Knight and Cage traveled to a diner to look for Ricky, where they found Ricky talking to his partner Rico. Knight threatened Ricky into giving her the location of the shipment. Once Ricky told Knight the location, she and Cage drove to the location where the guns were being shipped. Knight was able to steal the guns from the men who were shipping them, but one of Bushmaster's men threw a grenade into the truck. Cage managed to catch the grenade and toss it back at Bushmaster's men, but was then hit by the truck, knocking him unconscious. Knight ran Cage to the hospital while Bushmaster's men reclaimed their guns and returned them to Bushmaster.[3]\n\nPersonality\n\nTo be added\n\nAbilities\n\nExpert Combatant : Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.\n\n: Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.

Here's how you can tell them that you're not happy with this proposal, using just your email address.\n\nWho?\n\nIf you're concerned about online porn, you might have already signed a petition on the government's website calling for the default-on filter to be dropped. And in the wake of the controversy around the DEA, you might also have signed a petition demanding that ISPs should automatically block sites known to be involved in the distribution of online child abuse imagery. (Both of those petitions are still open for signatures if you want to join in).\n\nBut now it's time to tell the Government about some of the other things they're doing that are not as sensible, and we'll help you do it.\n\nWhat?\n\nFor a long time now, the UK Government has wanted to bring in a new Digital Economy Act. Last summer, the new law was finally published. The Act is massive, and there's lots to argue with, but it looks like the Government may be preparing to rush it through Parliament without any further debate. That means there's a limited window of opportunity to discuss changes to the draft before it becomes an Act of Parliament, and the Government starts work on enforcing it.\n\nThe draft DEA proposes a number of controversial new laws, including the opt-out default filter that's being discussed so widely. But the Act also proposes lots of other worrying measures, and gives the Government a lot more power to interfere with our online communications. The Act's supporters will tell you that it will help to tackle online infringement, for example. But its many critics argue that it risks stifling innovation in online services, and giving the Government a free hand to censor the internet in other ways.\n\nOn Monday, we told you that you could email your MP to demand a debate on the DEA. Now we've got even more reason to tell the Government that we're not happy with the draft DEA.\n\nThis week, the Pirate Party UK submitted a response to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) on the Digital Economy Act, which responds to the Government's consultation on the proposals. We're not the only ones with concerns about the proposals; the Open Rights Group has submitted its own response (pdf) to the Government's consultation, and Index on Censorship has produced a response (pdf).\n\nHere's why we think the Government's proposals are a Bad Thing:\n\nThe proposals for an &quot;Extended Liability for Platforms&quot; could have serious unintended consequences for small internet service providers and independent content sharing websites, making them responsible for policing their services and preventing copyright infringement. We think this is likely to stifle innovation in new services, and also has serious implications for our online privacy.\n\nThe plans for an automatic filtering system to block content that is not classified by the state could lead to a drastic over-blocking of content. It could block more than just &quot;extreme pornography&quot; - it could block access to anything the Government decides is inappropriate. There's no requirement for these filters to be accurate or transparent, so we won't even be able to tell what's been blocked.\n\nUnder the proposals, the Government would also have the power to block websites that it claims are &quot;blatantly&quot; or &quot;unlawfully&quot; infringing copyright. This could be a serious threat to online innovation, and to our online privacy. And again, there's no requirement for these blocks to be accurate or transparent.\n\nThe DEA would make it much easier for the Government to put in place more blocking orders, and extend their scope. The wording of the legislation is vague enough that it could be used to order ISPs to censor content that isn't even illegal. The Government has already said that it wants to use its new powers to stop us from accessing websites that might be used to share copyrighted material.\n\nThe DEA is the biggest threat to our online privacy since the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act. If the Government gets its way, then they'll have the power to block websites and track what we're doing online. And they'll be able to do it without even telling us that it's happening.\n\nYou can read the Pirate Party's full response to the DEA consultation here (pdf).\n\nNow we need your help\n\nIf you're concerned about the DEA, you can join us in telling the Government what you think about the proposed Act.\n\nThe Open Rights Group's response (pdf) to the DEA consultation is still open for signatures. Once they've got enough names on the petition, they'll send their response to the Government.\n\nAnd now we've got our own response to the Government's consultation on the Digital Economy Act. Please support our campaign to stop the Act by signing our response here (pdf).\n\nWe'll be sending our response to the Government later this week, and we hope that it will give people the opportunity to stop the Act before it's too late.\n\nThis is the one chance we have to stop the DEA.

It\u2019s a policy that seems to favour the government at the expense of foreign interests and brings into question whether or not the government has a commitment to fighting corruption and seeking justice.\n\nThe new policy has been met with much scrutiny both in Zimbabwe and internationally. Many have expressed concern that the implementation of the policy will be flawed and that it will ultimately lead to a worsening of the economic situation in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), has expressed its disapproval of the policy, stating that it will further marginalise Zimbabweans who aren\u2019t involved in the government or who support the opposition.\n\nOn the international level, the Indigenisation policy is one of the latest changes to the Zimbabwean government that have raised concern. Since he took office in November 2017, President Mnangagwa has brought the central bank and the national oil company under government control. This has led to further speculation about the political and economic direction that the government intends to take.\n\nIs the policy legal?\n\nThe Indigenisation policy was initially announced in 2010 and later replaced by another policy called the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim-Asset). The Zim-Asset policy, which was issued in 2013, introduced a set of guidelines for the process of indigenisation. It requires that 51% of all Zimbabwean businesses be transferred to the country\u2019s black majority. However, the policy has never been enforced.\n\nThe decision to revive the policy in 2017 has been widely criticised. Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement urging Mnangagwa to repeal the policy. HRW believes that the policy will only exacerbate the poor economic situation in Zimbabwe. The statement also notes that the government has never properly implemented the policy. It states that \u201cthe fact that no businesses have been indigenized in the past six years suggests that it is unworkable, and that it will not contribute to economic development or job creation.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the African Union, Zimbabwe is bound to uphold the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights, which contains specific provisions regarding the protection of private property.

It was developed by Guerrilla Cambridge (and published by Sony) and released on October 29th, 2016. It takes place in a futuristic sci-fi setting, where you play as one of a number of different characters. Each character uses a different kind of battle suit, allowing them to take part in 3 different sports. Those sports are essentially the 3 main games. They are called RIGS, Megaton, and Gravity Wars. These games play as though they\u2019re real sports. They play more or less how you\u2019d expect them to. You score points by hitting goals, and your objective is to take the ball, and score it in the goal.\n\nThe first game is RIGS, which is essentially a shooting game. There are multiple game modes. Each mode is the same, except you\u2019re playing different characters, and there\u2019s a different goal for you to hit. RIGS is the most fun game in the package, simply because it\u2019s a FPS, which is something you don\u2019t get a lot of in VR games.\n\nMegaton is a sort of bumper-car football game. It\u2019s the second most fun game in the package, just because it\u2019s an interesting spin on something we all know. It is also a lot easier to master than RIGS.\n\nGravity Wars is a very interesting concept, and very hard to master. The game has no physics, and you have to control your direction by using the stick on the right. It\u2019s very challenging, and once you get the hang of it, it can be fun.\n\nRIGS: Mechanized Combat League is a game that is good fun for those who have VR. There\u2019s nothing else like it. It has an interesting concept, and it makes for an interesting single player experience. The multiplayer is there if you want it, but if you don\u2019t, you can use bots, and they will be enough to let you master the game. It does have a lot of potential, and if Guerrilla Cambridge do a sequel, it will most likely be worth it.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat for VR\n\nVariety\n\nWell made\n\nGood concept\n\nCons:]" time="1.259"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9997790455818176" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Phantom ~ Opus 4 ~ Raw\n\n~ Chapter One ~\n\nTitle: Phantom ~ Opus 4 ~ Raw\n\nAuthor: Starfyre\n\nBeta: freddie-m\n\nPairing: Eventual MeixLu\n\nSummary: After 2 years of therapy, Liu is released back into the world and he returns to the only place he calls home.

Since I am in no way the author that Inu'sLurker is, I apologize for my lack of originality. But I thought that perhaps if I wrote about something that happened to me I would find it easier to write a story like this.\n\nAnd what happened to me was that one year, the day before my birthday, my mother and I went to China. Now that I look back on it, it was a very exciting trip, though at the time I was rather sad because I was turning twelve. I had been dreading the day, and it was nice to be with my mom because she always made me feel better.\n\nIt was also an interesting trip because we were staying with my Grandfather for a few weeks. He lived in Shanghai, and he was the one that took us to China in the first place. So it was an adventure for me to be in a place that he lived. I only saw my Grandfather on holidays, and it was a great experience.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this story as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\n- - - - -\n\nIt was just before eleven in the morning when we arrived at my grandfather's house.

It turns out not even close.\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that self-driving technology is more or less as old as the automobile itself. In fact, there are a number of cars on the road today with self-driving features, but they are only meant to assist the driver and not take over completely.\n\nOne such system, called Autopilot, was first launched by Tesla in October 2015. The main feature allows the car to drive itself on a highway, but it\u2019s still supposed to be monitored by the driver.\n\nUnfortunately, Tesla and Elon Musk have become a lightning rod for scrutiny after an accident last week that killed a Model X driver using Autopilot. A series of emails have revealed that Tesla has attempted to make it clear that Autopilot is not a \u201cself-driving\u201d feature.\n\nIn a recent letter to shareholders, Musk wrote, \u201cWhen used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? For one, this was an admission that the technology was not yet ready for public consumption.\n\nTesla is also being called to answer to whether or not the driver should have known that he was using the Autopilot feature. The company says the driver would have known since he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and the car\u2019s steering wheel was not in a locked position.\n\nA photo taken by a witness has been released, showing the driver looking down at something with his hands not on the wheel.\n\nThe automaker has since issued a recall to fix the issue and said it will be updating the Autopilot system to ensure that drivers stay engaged with the vehicle\u2019s operation.\n\nUber said it will be disabling the self-driving feature in its fleet of Volvo XC90s after one of its vehicles ran a red light in San Francisco last week, killing the woman. The car was in self-driving mode and the Uber employee behind the wheel wasn\u2019t able to take control of the vehicle in time.\n\nTesla and Uber are not alone in pursuing self-driving cars. Most automakers have some form of autonomous vehicle in the works, as well as companies like Google and Apple. Tesla is still the only automaker with a Level 5 vehicle that has no steering wheel or pedals, however.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Google\u2019s self-driving cars have only been involved in 11 accidents over the course of 1.5 million miles of driving, but most were caused by human error.\n\nGoogle has said that the biggest hurdle for self-driving cars will be the creation of a trust between car owners and their vehicle. To that end, the company has been testing a number of prototypes over the last several years, which they claim have driven millions of miles without causing any accidents.\n\nVolvo has been developing its own version of an autonomous vehicle for some time now, but the company is not going at it alone. They\u2019ve partnered with Uber, which bought some XC90 vehicles from Volvo, to run a fleet of self-driving Volvos for ride-hailing in Pittsburgh, where Uber\u2019s research center is located.\n\nWith the recent incidents involving Tesla and Uber, the questions of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s safe have only been heightened. Tesla is going to fix the problem with its Autopilot system and Uber is pausing its own self-driving testing, but it\u2019s clear that these vehicles are a long way from being ready for mass adoption.\n\nWill the driverless cars revolution ever happen? The answer seems to be a resounding yes, but it won\u2019t be anytime soon.]" time="2.012"><properties><property name="score" value="0.576872706413269" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Truly great parties start with quality lighting.

It has however changed the way in which tax relief on contributions to personal pensions is calculated.\n\nThe current situation, whereby the actual value of the tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution, as opposed to the rate of relief, is included in the calculation of income tax, has led to some confusion.\n\nThere is a belief that the relief that is received on the sum of a pension contribution is reduced to 10 per cent and therefore is not as good as the relief received on ISAs, where the actual value of the relief is not included in the calculation of income tax.\n\nThis misunderstanding may well have led to some people contributing to ISAs rather than pensions in order to maximise tax relief.\n\nIn addition, if the actual value of the tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution is used as a deduction from the gross amount of the pension contribution then the level of relief has not changed at all. The actual value of the relief received on the sum of a pension contribution in the income tax calculation has increased in line with the amount of gross income that is subject to tax relief.\n\nFor example, a gross contribution of \xa310,000 would result in an actual tax relief of \xa37,500 under the current arrangements (the gross contribution is grossed up by 50 per cent to give the net pension contribution of \xa37,500).\n\nUnder the new arrangements, the gross contribution would remain at \xa310,000, but the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution would be \xa37,000. The relief on the actual value of the pension contribution is not reduced to 10 per cent.\n\nThe amount of gross income that is subject to tax relief is now \xa340,000. If you earned this amount in income before your pension contributions, then the actual tax relief on the sum of the pension contribution would be \xa330,000, rather than \xa37,500.\n\nWhat has changed is the way in which the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution is calculated. The net pension contribution (the amount actually deducted from the gross income) will no longer be grossed up to produce the actual tax relief received on the sum of the pension contribution.\n\nTherefore, the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution will always be lower than the actual tax relief received on the actual value of a pension contribution.\n\nIt is important to note that it is not the rate of relief that is affected. It is the actual value of the relief that is reduced. The rate of relief is not affected.\n\nPension contributions are still exempt from tax, although the amount of income that is excluded from tax is less than it would have been if the relief was given on the actual value of the pension contribution.\n\nSecondly, the changes to the regulation of pensions and ISAs have not increased the level of tax relief on pensions. The actual level of tax relief on pensions has not changed. The maximum level of tax relief is still 40 per cent.\n\nThe regulation of pensions has changed. Under the new rules, the maximum amount that can be paid into a pension pot, subject to tax relief, is \xa31.8 million. The maximum amount that can be paid into an ISA, subject to tax relief, is \xa37,000.\n\nBoth the maximum contribution level of pensions and ISAs has increased, but the maximum tax relief that can be obtained on both types of products is the same.\n\nIf you have already opened a pension plan, then you can only increase the contribution amount by \xa32,880 per year. Any extra contribution beyond the annual limit will not be eligible for tax relief. The full value of the contribution, regardless of how much it is, will have to be paid from your gross income.\n\nThe actual level of tax relief on ISAs has not changed. The maximum amount of ISA contributions that can be paid into an ISA in any tax year is \xa37,000. This has not changed. Any amount that is paid into an ISA in excess of this amount will not be eligible for tax relief. The full value of the contribution, regardless of how much it is, will have to be paid from your gross income.\n\nSo in summary, the actual level of tax relief on ISAs has not changed. The maximum amount that can be paid into an ISA, subject to tax relief, is \xa37,000.\n\nThe actual]" time="2.361"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9998119235038757" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[How has music from Spain been perceived in its country of origin?

More often than not the game was a heated one and everyone, particularly the banker, enjoyed counting out money while money was being piled up all around the board.\n\nMonopoly is an interesting game for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, it requires the basic accounting function of making change. The cashier has to be able to count out the correct change for all the players. This seems like a very simple, but important function. If a cashier can\u2019t count change, you would have to return the money, and you might not get it back.\n\nAlso, with any money that comes into the game there are some decisions that have to be made. For example, with a loan, how much should be charged to each player. More importantly, how much can the players afford to pay back?\n\nIn addition, how much does the bank loan to the players and what are the terms? What does the bank require to be repaid? At what time? What happens if there is not enough money to pay back the bank?\n\nThis seems like an easy concept, but a lot of my kids had a difficult time trying to figure out what they had to do to get out of debt.\n\nFinally, there are times when players simply get too deep into debt. They are forced to sell off a building, or even the entire game.\n\nThis seems like a pretty simple concept, but I found it interesting because it taught some of my kids a very valuable lesson about life. They realized how important it is to have a budget. More importantly, they realized how much money they had to spend. They had to spend wisely because they couldn\u2019t go into debt.\n\nI think it\u2019s easy to teach kids to balance their checkbook and keep track of their spending, but it\u2019s much more difficult to teach them to spend wisely and stay out of debt.\n\nThe same goes for a family\u2019s bank account. Families, just like the player\u2019s in monopoly, need to keep track of the money coming into the bank account and what is going out. They need to make sure there is enough money to cover the things they need to pay for and that there is enough money to cover the things they want to spend money on. They need to be responsible with their money and realize they can\u2019t go into debt.\n\nThe game of Monopoly teaches a lot of these principles. It is not a game of instant gratification. There are no easy money schemes. It\u2019s a game that will test the mind and the ability to be responsible with money.\n\nIf you have kids, Monopoly is a great way to learn about personal finance. You don\u2019t need to be an expert, but you do need to be willing to show them how to count and account for money.]" time="1.527"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9998129407564799" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[The Bengals fell just short of a win in Kansas City Sunday, falling to the Chiefs 31-13. The loss drops the Bengals to 7-9, a number that still includes a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.\n\nOne of the biggest stories to come out of this loss is the fact that star running back Jeremy Hill was benched in favor of Rex Burkhead. Hill didn't have a good game, and the Chiefs were able to put him in his place. Burkhead was also pretty good, and scored the only Bengals touchdown on the day.\n\nBoth running backs ran for over 100 yards, but the key difference was Hill fumbled twice, including once inside the Chiefs' 20. Hill had carried the ball 39 times before the benching, while Burkhead had just nine.\n\nIt was announced Monday that Hill is still the Bengals' starting running back going forward.\n\n#Bengals Jeremy Hill named starting running back in 2018, Mixon to see more action. https://t.co/jZ9624gBwO pic.twitter.com/jOKGewN4zq \u2014 Kevin Clark (@bykevinclark) January 1, 2018\n\nThis is an interesting decision, considering the way the Bengals used the two running backs in Kansas City. Hill has been a solid running back throughout his career, but has shown lapses in concentration, as well as fumbling issues. He's not been consistent, and that has made the Bengals hesitant to hand him the starting job.\n\nThe Bengals will likely be looking to get more out of their running backs next season. We saw how talented Joe Mixon is this year, and he's the one who should have the starting job next season.\n\nHill will still be involved in the offense, but this change is a sign that he won't be a starter for the Bengals next season.]" time="0.849"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9848792552947998" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[This is the brand new video for \u201cSave Our Souls\u201d from the German melodic rockers CASANOVA.

For the first time in my life I am terrified that what I learned as a child is wrong. There is no more mother or father to turn to. There is no more food to count on. This is my last chance to sound the alarm that we are being systematically robbed and cheated and lied to and I don\u2019t know what we are going to do about it.\n\nA few years ago I could not have imagined that I would find myself writing this. I was born and raised in the village of Old Massett on Haida Gwaii, also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, in Canada. We fish and hunt and gather food and make our own shelter and build our own community. This is how it has been for thousands of years. In modern language this is called subsistence living. We were the last people in Canada to sign treaties with our colonial oppressors in the 1800s. These documents were the foundation of our way of life.\n\nThen it all changed in the early 2000s when the first commercial aquaculture license was issued on our coasts. At first, like most people on Haida Gwaii, I thought that farming fish would provide income for our community. Little did I know that the promise of wealth would come with a heavy price.\n\nThe first evidence I saw that something was wrong was in 2006. The sea lice were everywhere and a fish farm had started using a pesticide called Slice. I saw the sea lice on the fish and sea lions. I saw sea lions coughing up blood, the bones on their backs visible through their skin.\n\nIn 2007, the open net pen at salmon farm salmon feedlots one kilometre off the coast of my village collapsed. An estimated two to three million Atlantic salmon, with a value of $6.5 million to $8 million, swam into the ocean. There was no monitoring, no analysis of the risk to wild salmon, not a word to local communities.\n\nAnd then the toxins appeared. In 2008 and 2009 people in my village became sick and died. In the village of Klemtu next door, children were born with flipper-like hands and feet. In Norway, which had a higher concentration of fish farms, brain tumours and other cancers were rising and women were giving birth to deformed babies.\n\nI looked at these stories and thought, \u201cThis can\u2019t happen to us.\u201d\n\nThis was followed by the closure of the Haida Nation\u2019s only grocery store. People in my village and community started suffering from serious health problems, especially neurological ones. We were told it was due to influenza or SARS. We had no idea that a toxin, which our bodies have not evolved to handle, was being released into the air and our water. The Sea Around Us reported that fish farms were creating the most toxic area in the world, right next to the First Nations in Haida Gwaii. This happened, and no one told us.\n\nI realized I had to do something. For the first time in my life I realized that what my ancestors had always taught me was wrong. It was not nature that took care of us. It was we who were responsible for taking care of nature.\n\nI wrote my first letter to the local newspaper. It was my story, and I was afraid to publish it.\n\n\u201cHow many people have to get sick and die before they take this seriously?\u201d I asked.\n\nWe waited and waited, and nothing happened. I wrote my second letter. Nothing.\n\nWe waited and waited. Still nothing.\n\nPeople in my village got sick and died, and the Norwegian scientists kept warning that their food supply was being contaminated. We were told that this was the price of progress, that it was our job to clean up the mess. And we had to do it on our own.\n\nAnd then the baby seals came. There are no young sea lions, so the seals started eating the herring. At first we thought it was cute. Then we realized they were killing the herring. There were too many seals.\n\nI wrote my third letter. I looked at the numbers and saw that Norway was killing 80,000 seals a year and there were only 80,000 seals left.\n\nI started to organize rallies and a campaign called Save the Herring, which caught the attention of major news outlets across the globe. By this time I had a voice. I was a professor of biology at UBC and one of the world\u2019s experts on fish farming, open net pen fish farms, and marine pollution. I knew the science.\n\n\u201cHow many baby seals have to get cancer before they take this seriously?\u201d I asked.\n\nIn the midst of this, Canada approved a massive new open net pen farm. This was the largest salmon farm in the world. Our local paper warned us that \u201cthe massive farm will increase marine pollution in the area.\u201d This farm started dumping blood and feces into our waters. The evidence was mounting that we were at risk of a catastrophic collapse in our food web.\n\nBut no one cared. The aquaculture industry is worth $400 million a year. We can\u2019t compete with that.\n\nA new form of ocean zoning called an impact assessment was supposed to keep salmon farms out of sensitive areas, but it was all a lie. The people who wrote it are in the industry. They gave themselves exemptions.\n\nThen I realized that I could make a living as a scientist. So I created a lab at the University of Victoria to study the toxins from fish farms. We started to find the pollutants in the mussels and the herring. I published more and more scientific papers.\n\nWe held more rallies, and I wrote more and more letters to the local paper. We were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to the Supreme Court. Our case was thrown out, but the judge was extremely critical of the Canadian government and gave them 18 months to fix their laws. But the government is now granting the aquaculture industry a blanket exemption from environmental laws and protections. The judge told them that they could not do this. But they did.\n\nI have studied toxicology for 30 years and I have never seen this. We know that these toxins are not getting into our environment accidentally. The only reason they are there is because someone put them there. It is like they are trying to poison us.\n\nAnd then we started to see a new toxin. This time it was a by-product of the feed used in the salmon pens.\n\nA Norwegian scientist tested a by-product of salmon feed. The test showed that it was toxic. The Norwegian government stopped using the feed. In 2015, that same scientist tested all the salmon feed used in the British Columbia industry. The results showed that there was another new toxin, this time a carcinogen. The Norwegian scientist said, \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that it could happen at such high levels by chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many toxins have to get into our food before we take this seriously?\u201d I asked.\n\nThis time I knew that there was something wrong with my brain. We found out that Norway and Scotland were using the same feed. We had a toxic lab here in British Columbia, so what about Norway and Scotland? And the feed is approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and used in these salmon farms.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see who we are going to turn to.\n\nThen a woman in Ketch Harbour started asking questions. She wrote to the local paper and was ridiculed and insulted. She wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He never replied.\n\nShe was not from my village. She was a white woman from Newfoundland. Her grandfather was a fisherman.\n\nI wrote to her, and then I realized I could write to everyone. And I did. I started to get hundreds of people to write letters, and we wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and to our Premier, the head of our government. We wrote to every MLA, the Members of the Legislative Assembly, and we were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to court again. This time we were supported by 30 affidavits from fishermen and local citizens.\n\nI went to the hearings. The minister did not even show up. His lawyer said that we should stop questioning him and just accept that he is doing the right thing. He had no explanation as to why the 30 affidavits were not enough evidence to put a stop to this industrial salmon farming.\n\n\u201cIf I had a million dollars, I could save Haida Gwaii,\u201d I said.\n\nBut I have never been able to raise that money. The man who tried to stop me is now running for Premier, and he is the frontrunner.\n\nSo I wrote my fifth letter to the editor. I warned that if we continued to use this feed, we would all get sick and die.\n\nAnd then I realized that I could put this on Facebook.\n\nA few months ago, the BC government ordered the feed company to remove this toxin from their products. But they still sell it in other provinces. There is still no ban on the feed, even though Norway has banned it, the FDA has banned it, and Health Canada has banned it.\n\nAnd then I realized I could just get on a bus and go to Toronto and speak to people directly.\n\nSo that is what I am doing. I am going to make this my life\u2019s work. I am going to stand in front of people, in universities, in public hearings, and tell them my story.

He is also well known for his attempts to fuse the sciences with theology, something of a controversial topic for medieval theologians. The ontological argument itself is based upon the idea that God\u2019s nature is that of existence. Therefore, to say that God exists is to say that God has the greatest nature, which in turn leads to the conclusion that God must exist. Some scholars argue that this is the proof\u2019s most fundamental flaw, namely that God\u2019s nature is unprovable and thus, cannot be equated to the definition of existence. Other critics point out that the greatest nature is really a metaphysic and therefore cannot be understood by people. The latter claim has been supported by Immanuel Kant and many other philosophers since. Kant\u2019s work was not known to Anselm\u2019s, but it is clear that the German philosopher would not have found much use in Anselm\u2019s philosophy.\n\nThe foundation of Anselm\u2019s ontological argument is a branch of philosophy known as natural theology. Natural theology is the search for a knowledge of God through the use of reason. The argument\u2019s goal is to prove that God exists in some way, and as such is a concept that is widely accepted in the world of Christian philosophy. In many ways, Anselm\u2019s argument for God\u2019s existence shares many similarities with the arguments of many of his contemporaries. Anselm claims that God exists and that this conclusion can be proven using the method of defining terms. The proof proceeds from the claim that God is the greatest thing conceivable to the claim that God must also exist. Anselm\u2019s argument does not satisfy many people because it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that God is in fact the greatest conceivable thing. This is one of the major weaknesses of Anselm\u2019s argument, but it is also one of the weaknesses of most arguments for the existence of God. The ontological argument can be seen as an attempt to prove God\u2019s existence without supporting any specific philosophical view of God\u2019s nature.\n\nMuch of Anselm\u2019s work focuses on the attempts to explain and prove God\u2019s existence. He was one of the earliest of many philosophers to attempt to explain and prove God\u2019s existence. The debate over the existence of God has continued over the years, and the arguments have been supported and refuted on many different occasions. Anselm\u2019s work is important because he was one of the first philosophers to put forth the idea that existence itself was proof of God. He was also one of the first Christian philosophers to try and explain the idea of God in a non-theological way. Many of Anselm\u2019s contemporaries had rejected his view on God\u2019s nature, and they also criticized his work on natural theology.\n\nOne of the major debates over Anselm\u2019s work was that of the ontological argument. This is a popular concept that states that God\u2019s existence is a self-evident truth. The name of the argument comes from the phrase \u201csomething that is greater than which cannot be conceived\u201d. This concept became widely accepted in the world of Christian philosophy, and it is still being debated today. The concept of God\u2019s existence as a self-evident truth has been supported by many Christian philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas\u2019 view of God was one of the most influential views of God\u2019s nature in the Middle Ages. The ideas presented by Anselm and Aquinas on God\u2019s nature were among the first attempts to view God in a logical way.\n\nMost of Anselm\u2019s work focused on the idea of God and the way in which God was perceived. He focused on the idea that God was perceived through faith and that this idea had a real and substantial foundation. Many critics viewed Anselm as a philosophical follower of Augustine, and he was certainly influenced by many of Augustine\u2019s works. The Confessions of Augustine were written in the fifth century, and they discussed the views of the time on God and the manner in which people should understand God. Anselm\u2019s view of God is therefore quite different from many of his contemporaries, and he was heavily criticized for his work on natural theology.\n\nThe ideas presented by Anselm were extremely influential to his contemporaries. Although his ideas were at times criticized, many of his contemporaries found them to be the most logical views of God. His argument for God\u2019s existence was extremely popular among his peers, but it is one of his most controversial works.\n\nAnselm of Canterbury Biography\n\nAnselm of Canterbury was born in 1033 in Aosta. He was the second of four sons and his parents were wealthy. Anselm\u2019s father was an Italian who owned a noble estate. His mother was the niece of the archbishop of Rheims. Anselm was well educated, and he studied both rhetoric and literature as a young man. He studied law in 1057 at the cathedral school in Laon. During this time, he became close friends with Roscelin of Compi\xe8gne. Roscelin was an expert on logic, and he would be one of Anselm\u2019s best friends and mentors for the rest of his life. He was also close to Lanfranc and eventually became his student.\n\nAnselm studied theology in the early 1060s at the cathedral school of Chartres. He also spent a great deal of time studying theology and grammar at the school of Benevento. Anselm spent two years at the school and was then called to the cathedral school of Canterbury in 1062. Anselm was called to the cathedral school to replace the archbishop. The archbishop of Canterbury was the highest ranking prelate in England and he was charged with the administration of the Church in England. Anselm quickly gained respect in his new position, and he wrote a new rule for the cathedral school. The rule was based on the Rule of St. Benedict, which was the most important rule for monasteries at the time. He was also responsible for the cathedral school\u2019s many other duties and its administration. He established the system of electing canons and was also in charge of its finances. Anselm had a great deal of power in his new position, but he also was a reformer. He placed emphasis on the importance of education and scholarship, and he ensured that the students received high quality instruction. The rule at the cathedral school was seen as being high quality and the students at the school were trained in Greek, Latin, rhetoric, dialectic, and arithmetic.\n\nAnselm also established a library at the school. The library contained many ancient works, which were frequently read by students. He became an expert on the writings of Augustine, and he began his own writing career in the early 1060s. His writings were influential in the development of later philosophy, and his ideas on natural theology were both influential and controversial. In 1063, Anselm was appointed archbishop of Canterbury. This was an extremely important position, and Anselm would play a major role in the Christianization of England. He was a major contributor to the revival of learning in England, and he attempted to bring education to all of his subjects.\n\nHe was a skilled theologian, and he produced several important theological works. These included the Monologion and the Proslogion. The Monologion addressed the questions of the nature of God. The Proslogion addressed the questions of the nature of God\u2019s knowledge and the proof for God\u2019s existence.

On February 25 1915 the first ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, a total of 11,000. The rest of the 20,000 strong force arrived over the following weeks.\n\nMany of the ANZAC troops had volunteered at the outbreak of war, lured by the romantic and patriotic view of warfare and by a yearning for adventure.\n\nJust as the troops were largely made up of volunteers, the casualties at Gallipoli were also predominantly made up of volunteers.\n\nIt has been estimated that 10 percent of all the Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli were killed during the campaign.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies commented that \u201cthe experience of war for Australians would always be Gallipoli\u201d.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the ANZAC troops, the British had launched an attack on the Gallipoli peninsula on the 25th of April 1915.\n\nThe Allied attack consisted of five divisions, with most of the troops coming from the British Army. It was hoped that the landings would help the British Navy to get through the Dardanelles, a narrow strip of water separating the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara, which leads to the Bosphorus and the Black Sea.\n\nHowever, the initial landings met with great opposition from the Turkish defenders, and the Allied forces soon became pinned down on the beaches and unable to advance.\n\nThe ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, the capital of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s European territories, just over a month later on the 19th of May 1915.\n\nThe ANZACs had initially been part of the British and French force in Egypt. They were moved to a separate command under General Ian Hamilton, with Australian General William Birdwood as his deputy.\n\nA General Order issued on the 3rd of May stated that the Australian and New Zealand troops were to be given \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d duties from those of the British.\n\nThis was not intended to be interpreted as any form of segregation. Rather, it was due to the fact that the Australians and New Zealanders, despite being part of the British Empire, were soldiers who had volunteered from their own country, and who had formed a unique sense of national identity and pride.\n\nIn order to maintain a clear distinction between the Allied forces and the enemy, the ANZACs also adopted their own distinctive insignia, such as a yellow or red poppy on their badges and hats.\n\nHowever, despite the greater efforts to set the ANZACs apart from their Allied allies, the treatment of the soldiers at Gallipoli was the same as that received by the British.\n\nThe ANZACs were given responsibility for the defence of the Anzac Cove, at the northernmost tip of the Gallipoli Peninsula.\n\nThe cove was strategically important to the Turks because of its proximity to the Narrows, the strip of water which separated the peninsula from the Dardanelles.\n\nThe Anzacs were also expected to hold on to the various hills and ridges along the peninsula, despite the fact that the Allied positions were in constant danger of being shelled]" time="2.352"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9980734705924987" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[V6 engines had too much power to safely make use of the front wheels alone.

It also has a couple of holes on the side, so that you can clean it and store it without having to remove the portafilter. The concept is pretty ingenious, but I had some difficulty in actually getting it to work properly.\n\nIn theory, the machine takes a lot of the stress out of making espresso.

The lake is located in a canyon along the Colorado River, nestled at the base of a rock formation called the Palisades. The National Monument, also known as The Dots, is a rock formation of mostly red and orange that spans for about a mile along the Colorado River.\n\nThe Dots.\n\nHanging Lake is a water body that was formed by lava over millions of years, according to the National Park Service. The water body is fed by a small underground river and water seeps out through the canyon walls to form the lake.\n\nHanging Lake is known as one of the most picturesque lakes in the country, and often the photos seen online or on Instagram have a filter on them. The color of the water is bright blue, the rocks are a fiery red and orange, and the waterfalls are turquoise blue.\n\nA tourist sits by the Hanging Lake waterfall.\n\n&quot;It's an excellent opportunity to do some waterfall photography,&quot; said Ben Lin, a Denver resident. &quot;That is what drew me here, the waterfall, and I don't know why, but it is very hard to take a bad picture here.&quot;\n\nLin has been to Hanging Lake several times, the first time in 2015.

When you're done swimming there is all that debris and gunk on the lake, you can't see it from up above, but as you're swimming you feel the gunk and rocks in the bottom of the lake.&quot;\n\nAlthough swimming is prohibited, people do still swim in the lake, which causes the algae to increase, according to the National Park Service.\n\nHanging Lake is one of the first stops for many travelers, but after leaving the picturesque sight, many people don't realize there is so much more to Fruita than Hanging Lake.\n\nNext time you are passing through the small town of Fruita, consider stopping at Hanging Lake Lodge for lunch, a short hike, or an afternoon in a hammock.

The Object class is an abstract class and doesn't have a constructor. If you don't have any idea what I'm talking about here, don't worry about it for now. I'll explain it in detail in Chapter 5. You can't instantiate an object from the Object class, so the only real purpose of the Object class is to serve as a base class for other classes. You can think of the Object class as being like a template that all other classes derive from. If you want to learn more about how classes work and how you can customize Excel's classes to create your own customized classes, check out my Microsoft Press book Microsoft Excel VBA and Macros (ISBN 0-7356-1845-0).\n\nWhen you create a class module in your Excel application, you must specify the class name as a string literal. For example, if you create a class module called Class1, Excel uses the following syntax in the declarations area of the class module to specify the name of the class:\n\nPublic Class Class1 End Class\n\nAs with any other module in Excel, a class module doesn't do anything until you create an object from the class module. Creating an object is a two-step process: You first instantiate the object, and then you call the methods and properties of the object. For example, to create an object from the class named Class1, you use the following code:\n\nDim obj1 As New Class1\n\nOnce you create an instance of the object, you can call the methods and properties of the object by preceding the method or property name with the name of the object. For example, if you created an instance of the class named Class1, you would use the following code to call the method named Display:\n\nobj1.Display\n\nIf the object contains an object variable that represents another object of the same class, you can also call the methods of that object. For example, if the object named obj1 created in the preceding code contained an object variable named obj2 that represented another object of the same class, you would use the following code to call the Display method of the object named obj2:\n\nobj1.obj2.Display\n\nThe property and method names of a class are preceded by the name of the class, as shown in the preceding examples.\n\nIf you create a class module that contains a custom collection object, such as a collection of cells in a worksheet, you must use a new operator to create the collection object. For example, the following statement creates a collection object named myCol1 that is a collection of worksheet cells:\n\nDim myCol1 As New Collection\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you specify the type of object that the collection can contain when you define the type of the collection.\n\nFor example, the following statement creates a collection object that can contain only the cells in a worksheet:\n\nDim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range)\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you can add items to the collection object by using the Add method of the collection object.\n\nFor example, the following statement adds a range named &quot;Region&quot; to the collection object named myCol1:\n\nmyCol1.Add mySheet.Range(&quot;Region&quot;)\n\nThe Add method takes two arguments:\n\n\u25a0 The object that you want to add to the collection object\n\n\u25a0 The collection that you want to add the object to\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you can add an object to a collection object that is an instance of a different class, but the type of the objects in the collection must be the same.\n\nThe following code example adds the range named &quot;Region&quot; to the collection object named myCol1. This code example assumes that you've created the objects in the declaration section of the class module.\n\nSub AddObjectToCollection() Dim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range) Dim myRow As Long, myColumn As Long Dim strName As String ' Obtain a reference to the collection ' that contains the first worksheet in ' the active workbook. Set myCol1 = Sheets(1).Range(1, 1). _ SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible) ' Initialize the name of the cell ' to the value of the Name property. strName = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Value ' Determine the address of the cell ' and store it in the myRow and myColumn ' variables. myRow = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Address myColumn = myCol1.Cell(1, 2).Address ' Create a new Range object. Set myRange = Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;). _ Range(&quot;Region&quot;) ' Add the new range to the collection. myCol1.Add myRange End Sub\n\nThe following code example calls the AddObjectToCollection method to add the range named &quot;Region&quot; to the collection object named myCol1. This code example assumes that you've created the objects in the declaration section of the class module.\n\nSub AddObjectToCollectionWithMethodCall() Dim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range) Dim myRow As Long, myColumn As Long Dim strName As String ' Obtain a reference to the collection ' that contains the first worksheet in ' the active workbook. Set myCol1 = Sheets(1).Range(1, 1). _ SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible) ' Initialize the name of the cell ' to the value of the Name property. strName = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Value ' Determine the address of the cell ' and store it in the myRow and myColumn ' variables. myRow = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Address myColumn = myCol1.Cell(1, 2).Address ' Create a new Range object. Set myRange = Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;). _ Range(&quot;Region&quot;) ' Add the new range to the collection. myCol1.AddObject myRange ' Add another range to the collection ' and display the number of elements in the collection. myCol1.Add myRange MsgBox myCol1.Count End Sub\n\nThe final statement in the AddObjectToCollectionWithMethodCall subroutine is a good example of how you can use a method that belongs to a class to call the methods of the collection object.\n\n0 0]" time="3.545"><properties><property name="score" value="0.7163082261880239" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Title\n\nInsurance Leads\n\nDescription\n\nWe are a leading Insurance Agency in Central Ohio offering all types of insurance.

This is mostly false. A new study has revealed that raising the minimum wage does not kill jobs. This is not just good news for the people who will now get a raise, but also for the economy as a whole.\n\nOpponents of the minimum wage often say that it will create a lot of unemployment and that this is proof that the minimum wage should be abolished. They argue that it creates a job loss on an economy-wide scale. However, this new study has proved that the minimum wage will not cause massive job loss. This is not just great news for the people who get a raise, but it also means that the economy will benefit.\n\nThe study comes from the National Employment Law Project (NELP) and reveals that raising the minimum wage does not cause massive job loss. In fact, only two percent of the workforce is impacted by a minimum wage increase. This means that the economy will benefit, but not that much. However, it is still a positive impact.\n\nHowever, the study also shows that the country would have to raise the minimum wage by $2.13 to achieve the same number of jobs as a similar increase in the 1990s. This is not really a surprise, as the economy was growing more rapidly back then.\n\nRaising the minimum wage was also seen to boost the economy. The study found that a $1 increase in the minimum wage would increase the GDP by $2.62. This is a significant amount and would be great for the economy as a whole. In fact, it could even boost the economy so much that it could lift more people out of poverty.\n\nWhile a raise in the minimum wage does not have a massive impact on the economy as a whole, it still has a positive impact. This means that the people who will now get a raise will enjoy it. This will also help the economy, and make the country a better place to live in.\n\nThose who oppose the minimum wage should know that it does not create massive unemployment.

The goal, a result of a breakaway due to an errant pass by Kings defenseman Slava Voynov, was the second of Ha\u0161ek's career. His first goal was scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2008. The goal also made him the oldest goaltender in NHL history to score a goal in a game. The record was previously held by Tommy Salo, who scored a goal in a game at the age of 35.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Ha\u0161ek underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder.\n\nHa\u0161ek was injured during the 2011\u201312 preseason, and on October 2, 2011, was placed on long-term injured reserve by the Red Wings. He returned from his injury to back up Ty Conklin for a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on November 29, 2011.\n\nOn July 5, 2012, Ha\u0161ek signed a one-year, $2.05 million contract with the Florida Panthers. He was named the starting goaltender in the Panthers' inaugural game in the 2012\u201313 season against the New Jersey Devils. He was subsequently pulled in the first period after allowing 4 goals on 15 shots. He was replaced by Scott Clemmensen, and on January 24, 2013, Clemmensen was named as the Panthers' starting goaltender for the remainder of the season.\n\nHa\u0161ek was placed on waivers by the Panthers on June 13, 2013. Ha\u0161ek was then bought out from the final year of his contract on June 15, 2013. He was then signed by the Detroit Red Wings for the 2013\u201314 season to backup starter Jimmy Howard.\n\nHa\u0161ek became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, and on September 11, 2014, signed his first contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga. After one season in Pardubice, Ha\u0161ek opted to continue in the Extraliga, signing a two-year deal with HC V\xedtkovice. In his second season with V\xedtkovice, Ha\u0161ek helped his club claim its first league title since 1999, appearing in 15 playoff games. He left as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with HC Pardubice on June 19, 2017.\n\nHa\u0161ek played for the Czech Republic at the 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 World Championships, winning bronze in 2004 and 2005. Ha\u0161ek was the starting goaltender for the Czech Republic team that won the gold medal at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nIn 2003, Ha\u0161ek became a Canadian citizen, but had already represented the Czech Republic in international competition, and he was therefore eligible to play for either national team. On November 7, 2005, he announced that he would continue to represent the Czech Republic, even though he had been approached by the Canadian team and was eligible to play for Canada. Ha\u0161ek's younger brother Ond\u0159ej also plays professional hockey.\n]" time="4.019"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9473894323621478" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Helium leak\n\nA helium leak is a leak of helium from its container.\n\nHelium is a diatomic gas and therefore more difficult to confine than many other gases.

That is exactly the case with Andreas Antonopoulos. He has reportedly been bombarded with requests from individuals who want to make donations to his projects. But he has no means of receiving them.\n\nIs Andreas Antonopoulos Being Misled?\n\nMost people know Andreas Antonopoulos by now. He is one of the most popular and prolific figures in the Bitcoin world. However, the widespread adoption of Bitcoin has led to a lot of new users, many of whom do not have a great understanding of the technology. That is not necessarily a bad thing, though.\n\nIt now appears as if a lot of people think Andreas Antonopoulos accepts donations, whereas he doesn\u2019t. As such, people keep bombarding the Bitcoin community icon with messages asking how they can make a donation. This leads to quite a few jokes being made about it on social media. However, Andreas Antonopoulos is well aware of the situation, as he keeps getting the same questions.\n\nHowever, the most intriguing part of this situation is how Andreas Antonopoulos makes it clear he doesn\u2019t accept donations. For some reason, some people continue to pester him about it. Some individuals even claim they are only able to donate a small amount of money, which would make no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe Andreas Antonopoulos Donation Account\n\nInterestingly enough, Andreas Antonopoulos is quite open about Bitcoin donations, but only to the extent of signing them over to projects. That is not what most people would expect, but it makes a lot of sense to give this money to a good cause. For example, Antonopoulos has donated over US$5,000 worth of Bitcoin to help rebuild the war-torn Marawi in the Philippines. It is evident this money came from donations he received, which is a very interesting development.\n\nThat being said, donations can still be made to Andreas Antonopoulos, even though it is done in a different way. Instead of sending money to his personal wallet, a public Bitcoin wallet has been created for donations to be sent to. That wallet has been active for some time now, and users can send money to a wide range of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash wallets.\n\nDo you think donations should be sent to Andreas Antonopoulos?

In 1831, a convict ship called the \u201cDuke of Wellington\u201d (there are other tales about the origins of the name) ran aground here and was eventually abandoned. The women were moved to Fremantle Prison. The wreck is still there, but it is being eaten by the sea. You can walk to it on a path from Waterhouse Beach. The best way to see the island is by bike, though, because it is so small and flat. The bikes are provided by a company called Island Experience Rottnest. This is a great way to see the island. It costs around $25, which gets you a bike and the unlimited use of it for three hours. They give you a map and instructions, but you can see the whole island by walking in about an hour.\n\nThere are very few buildings here, but what there are have a very interesting history. For example, there is the Weeroona Hotel, the oldest operating hotel in the state. It is run by a company that is owned by the island\u2019s inhabitants. The oldest building is called the Round House. It was built in 1833 and has been restored to the 1830s period. It used to be the men\u2019s quarters. There is also a small cathedral that was built in 1901, and is called St Mary\u2019s Cathedral. There is also a cricket ground here that was originally established in the 1840s. This island was once the penal colony. The ruins of two of the prisons, the Governor\u2019s residence and the convicts\u2019 huts can be seen. They are located at a place called Settlement.\n\nCamel Rock\n\nThis is the most important landmark of the island. It is visible for many miles, and is sometimes mistaken for a camel. The sandstone is interesting, as it was formed from quartzite, which is a very hard stone. Some of the grains have been turned to iron oxide, which is a reddish brown. This was done by chemical reactions that were the result of oxygen and iron.\n\nSome rock formations can also be seen at the Quobba station, which is a restored 19th century railway station. There are a few lookouts here, but the best is at Arch Rock, which is a short distance from the main road. There are about 200 species of birds here, and there is a sanctuary that is managed by a conservation group called the Rottnest Island Conservation Society. This is home to the Tawny Frogmouth, the Black-breasted Button-quail, the Malleefowl, and the Rottnest Island White-tailed Black-Cockatoo.\n\nThere is also an Interpretive Centre that explains the history of the island and its different birds. Another reason to visit this island is the fact that the Aboriginal people, the Wadjuk, were here first. There is an Aboriginal reserve that is in the northern area of the island, and there is also a sacred site that can be seen there. The site is called Yanjul, which means \u201cman with spear\u201d. The local Aboriginals still refer to the island as Wadjemup, which means \u201cIsland of Peace\u201d. The First Fleet stopped at this island, and as such it is the only island in the world where two different nations fought for control.\n\nPlaces to Stay\n\nThere are a few different places to stay on this island. Most of the accommodations are self catering. There are also a few bed and breakfasts, and there is even a four star hotel called the Sheraton Rottnest Island Resort. There are over 250 different cottages to stay at, some of which have been converted from old army barracks. The Great Western Hotel is the only hotel here that has electricity and telephone connections, so you may want to stay there if you want to be near the center of things.

Yet, the history of cannabis in California has been a long one \u2014 and not without its rocky moments.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s medical marijuana laws were first approved by voters in 1996 and ushered in a sea change in cannabis culture and use. Yet even in the heyday of Proposition 215, there were raids on medical dispensaries, law enforcement shutting down shops for violation of local zoning codes and municipal zoning laws, local municipalities levying taxes on dispensaries and even offering up community space in which to open shops.\n\nThe result of these early legislative setbacks? The displacement of a long-established network of dispensaries and cultivators. Those who could no longer get by in the state moved to Oregon, Washington, Colorado and other legal states \u2014 essentially exporting the cannabis culture they had created. Now, a new generation of cultivators and distributors are starting businesses in California, with new methods and processes that are a result of the new cannabis industry.\n\nEven as recreational marijuana use became legal in California in January 2018, there has been an uptick in raids of these newly legal businesses, which remains illegal under federal law.

That video is trying to make it seem like some statements made by Dan Abnett about the use of the term &quot;boy&quot; or &quot;son&quot; when applied to the Raven Guard during the Horus Heresy was a form of apologism for using &quot;boyz&quot; when referring to Orks. This is not the case. While it is true that Abnett's statements were inappropriate, the content of that video fails to really show it. For example, where the video claims that Abnett said &quot;Raven Guard don't ever call themselves boys&quot;, Abnett was in fact saying that Raven Guard did not ever call themselves &quot;boyz&quot; or any other similar slang. He specifically mentioned &quot;boyz&quot; in the context of Orks as an example, and it is the video that is now misrepresenting his words. In other words, Abnett's statements on the subject of Orks are accurate, and the video's attempt to show him in a negative light is based on a misrepresentation.\n\nAdditionally, your claim that the Imperium is &quot;far from perfect&quot; is not true, as the Imperium's culture is based around the worship of the Emperor, who has deified himself and is often referred to as a god by Imperial citizens. This means that the Imperium has absolutely no separation between religion and government, which means that your claim that the Imperium is &quot;far from perfect&quot; is also a form of apologism, as it is ignoring a key element of the Imperium that should be readily apparent to any Imperial citizen. The use of &quot;Apologetic&quot; is a misuse of the word and also misrepresents what the author is trying to say, as you have misrepresented the claim he is making.\n\nThe author's second &quot;claim&quot; is incorrect on many levels, and is also based on a misrepresentation of facts. Firstly, let's take a look at the quote he links to:\n\n&quot;If we wanted to do a straight-up Space Marines game, we would have done Space Marines, right? They\u2019re the coolest guys.&quot;\n\nThis quote is taken out of context. The quote actually goes on to explain why they chose to do the Space Marines as they did. In fact, the quote was in response to a question about why they decided to make Space Marines so &quot;stereotypically heroic&quot; in terms of a tone. The statement that follows in the quote states that it is because Space Marines are the &quot;coolest guys&quot; in the galaxy. What the author is doing here is taking a single quote and presenting it as if it is the entirety of the explanation of why Space Marines are the way they are in this game, when that is not the case.\n\nThe author's next claim is that he does not agree with the statement about the inclusion of certain races, but instead of explaining why he disagrees, he simply says that it is &quot;wrong&quot;. This does not actually prove that the statement is incorrect, and is a form of dog-whistle politics, as it is deliberately vague and meant to be interpreted as &quot;political correctness&quot; or &quot;SJW&quot; or &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; and similar things, all of which are highly charged words. He could very easily have explained why he disagrees with the statement, but he did not. Instead, he chose to attempt to shut down any further discussion of the topic with a rather obscure quote, while also using a misrepresentation of the quote to try and do so.\n\nThe author's final claim is based on another misrepresentation of the source material. In his article, the author linked to an article that states that the developers actually took fan-feedback into account when designing the Space Marine Chapters. In fact, the developers mentioned that they were &quot;watching&quot; the fans' reactions to the game, and were taking note of how the game was received and what fans' concerns were, which is in line with what the developers have said about their reasons for making the Space Marine Chapters they did.\n\nOnce again, the author is trying to use his article as a form of dog-whistle politics, as he is taking these claims and trying to make it seem as if the developers were lying. However, even if the developers were lying about this, which they are not, that does not invalidate the author's argument. In other words, the author's claims that the developers are lying about this are irrelevant to the argument the author is making, and should not be considered when assessing the validity of his arguments.\n\nIn the author's first sentence, he claims that it is &quot;common knowledge&quot; that the Imperium of Man is based on Nazi Germany. However, I do not believe that this is actually true, as I have never heard this before, and the idea seems rather outlandish. In fact, the idea that the Imperium of Man is based on Nazi Germany is so outlandish that it makes me question the author's sanity. Furthermore, his claim is an appeal to emotion, as the author does not really explain why he thinks this, and instead simply uses an emotionally charged accusation.\n\nIn the author's second sentence, he claims that the Space Marine Chapters, as well as the Emperor, are based on &quot;fascist leadership&quot;. I have already addressed the author's claim about the Space Marine Chapters, and I will now address his claim about the Emperor. While I cannot speak for the Emperor's actual policies, he is still worshiped as a god by most of the citizens of the Imperium, which does not actually fit with the definition of &quot;fascist leadership&quot;. Furthermore, the author does not really explain how he came to the conclusion that the Emperor is based on fascist leadership, and instead simply asserts it without any real explanation.\n\nThe author's third claim is based on a misrepresentation of facts, and is yet another form of dog-whistle politics. His claim that a representation of the logo of the White Legion is on the flag of the Imperium is a misrepresentation of the source material. In the source material, it is explicitly stated that the White Legion and the Imperial flag are two separate things, with the author's claim making it seem as if the White Legion is the official flag of the Imperium of Man. This is, of course, untrue. In fact, the White Legion is not even in the same star system as the Imperium, so the White Legion's flag is actually irrelevant to the argument that the author is making.\n\nThe author's fourth claim is also based on a misrepresentation of facts, as well as yet another form of dog-whistle politics. The author claims that the developers stated that the Imperium is &quot;an alliance between Humans and aliens&quot;. While I cannot speak for what the developers actually stated, I can point out that they did not state that the Imperium was an alliance between Humans and aliens. The author's statement that this claim is &quot;common knowledge&quot; is false. In fact, if this was common knowledge, then the author would not have needed to claim that this was what the developers had said. Instead, he would have just cited the developers as having said it. In other words, his claim that this is &quot;common knowledge&quot; is also a form of dog-whistle politics, as it is a claim that is designed to be interpreted as &quot;political correctness&quot; or &quot;SJW&quot; or &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; and similar things, all of which are highly charged words.\n\nIn the author's final claim, he says that the Orks are portrayed as a generic enemy of the Imperium, when in fact they are a threat to the Imperium. The author claims that &quot;Boyz&quot; is used as an insult by the Imperium, when in fact it is used to refer to any Ork. In other words, his claim that the Imperium is &quot;far from perfect&quot; is incorrect, and in fact is a form of dog-whistle politics.]" time="4.138"><properties><property name="score" value="0.999787375330925" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[The general consensus in psychology is that intelligence is a singular entity that can be measured and is unchangeable, and that any issues with intelligence will remain constant throughout a person\u2019s life.\n\n\n\nIn general, the accepted view of intelligence is based on a series of experiments carried out in the 1940s and 50s, commonly referred to as the IQ tests.

He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. The striving to free oneself from this delusion is the one issue of true religion. Not to nourish the delusion but to try to overcome it is the way to reach the attainable measure of peace of mind.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1938)\n\nWho would have thought that the the famous scientist, whose ideas took a leap of imagination that seemed to defy common sense, had so much wisdom to share.\n\nEinstein's wisdom, delivered in a simple, direct manner, is of a philosophical nature. And yet, as we have seen, his wisdom is based on a scientific perspective, not a philosophical one. It is a perspective that, as we shall see, stands in contrast to the beliefs of the average person.\n\nThe ultimate source of Einstein's wisdom is his sense of awe. He speaks of being in awe of what he observed in nature, as if these observations of nature had moved him to the core of his being. But this awe was not the end of the matter for Einstein. He does not speak of being in awe and then simply stop and say: &quot;What a wondrous world it is.&quot; Rather, he looks to this sense of awe as a source of inspiration to do more.\n\nEinstein's wisdom is the result of a personal approach to understanding and the sense of awe that this approach has produced. It is, therefore, both a personal and a shared source of wisdom. The person sharing this wisdom is not speaking on behalf of some outside authority, like a philosopher or a scientist. His wisdom is simply the result of a personal quest, not a more generalized, impersonal, public investigation.\n\nEinstein did not discover his wisdom by himself. He spoke about his awe at the &quot;dignity&quot; of nature, by which he meant that the world of nature is majestic, not cheap. Einstein was aware of the sense of awe that his discoveries had evoked in him and he wished to share this feeling with others. In this way, Einstein's wisdom was, at its roots, a shared resource, because the more people who can feel and express awe at the majesty of nature, the better it is for all of us.\n\nIt is as though Einstein had an innate wisdom that he wished to share with others, and as though he felt compelled to do so. Einstein's quest for wisdom was not an abstract exercise in which he wished to understand nature or the meaning of life. Rather, Einstein was driven by a need to share his insights. As the physicist Stephen Hawking has pointed out, the very nature of the scientific enterprise is a social activity, and this is as true of Einstein as it is of Hawking himself.\n\nLike Hawking, Einstein had the good fortune of being born into a social context that could support his quest for wisdom. He lived in an environment in which he was exposed to an intellectual culture that had been nourished by many philosophers who were also his contemporaries. He could, therefore, both draw from the wisdom of his predecessors and challenge them by articulating the insights that he had achieved.\n\nIn addition, the new physics that he helped to develop has spawned many technologies that have radically transformed our understanding of the world and has introduced new scientific disciplines, such as quantum physics, that have enriched our understanding of nature. Our scientific knowledge has become a shared resource that can be used as a basis for developing a new kind of wisdom, one that does not exist in the history of human thought before the twentieth century.\n\nAs we can see, the search for wisdom and the sharing of wisdom are based on a wide array of factors. To create a context that will allow for the growth of a new kind of wisdom, one that can benefit the common good of humanity, it is necessary to invest in science and in a new philosophical perspective.\n\nIn other words, a new kind of wisdom can only arise as the result of a new synthesis, one that links scientific knowledge with a philosophical perspective. It is this new synthesis that will be explored in the final chapter of this book.]" time="2.277"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9362875580787658" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Gone are the days of fighting with finicky and slow 3D printers; with the new Prusa i3 MK3S, you get the benefits of simplicity, accessibility, and a whole lot more.

At the time, a study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that just 18 percent of Americans consider Hollywood stars to be good role models, and just 10 percent said the same for politicians. \u201cIf the group that you are the leader of is viewed that way, you have to examine what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Smith said.\n\nOn this day, Smith was concerned about children around the world who are not receiving the care they need to survive. As he read about the dire need for vaccines, Smith thought about his own two kids, and how helpless he would feel if they were sick and dying. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what that must be like. So for me, the easiest thing to do is to support UNICEF. Because when my children get sick, it\u2019s my job to get them help, and if they die, they die. I\u2019m not gonna stop that. I\u2019m not God. But when children around the world get sick and die, it\u2019s God\u2019s responsibility. And I have to believe that God will ask him, \u2018Are you there?\u2019 And when He says, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m there,\u2019 he\u2019ll say, \u2018Are you there?\u2019 And he\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019m there,\u2019 and God will say, \u2018Well, why didn\u2019t you help these children?'\u201d\n\nIn one year, UNICEF vaccinates 46 million children against preventable diseases. Every dollar invested in immunization results in $44 saved in treatment. UNICEF reaches children in 190 countries and territories. Each year, with the help of its many partners, UNICEF supplies more than 50 million children under the age of five with immunizations against the six life-threatening diseases: pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhea, polio, measles, and tetanus. UNICEF also supports the vaccination of pregnant women in countries where the practice has been shown to prevent transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to newborns. In addition, UNICEF is the largest distributor of antiretroviral medicines for children and pregnant women with HIV in the developing world.\n\nUNICEF also provides thousands of training opportunities for community health workers to deliver health services to children in their own communities. UNICEF, through its extensive network of child protection partners, also provides psychological support and counselling for children and adolescents affected by violence, abuse and exploitation. For millions of children who would otherwise die, it is UNICEF that saves lives.\n\nIn response to the global refugee crisis, UNICEF is at the forefront of emergency response efforts to help children and families who are fleeing conflict and violence. The agency has distributed more than 1 million emergency packages in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan, and has provided over 1.5 million people with emergency supplies including tents, kitchen sets, heaters and sleeping mats. UNICEF has established 41 child-friendly spaces for traumatized children in the region and continues to provide medical and psychosocial support, protection and assistance for refugees.\n\nIn 2016, UNICEF\u2019s commitment to the protection of children in conflict was formally recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Prize was awarded to UNICEF \u201cfor its work for children in developing countries, and for long-standing advocacy in favor of children\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and UNICEF first partnered in 1953, to help children devastated by the Korean War. From that time, their relationship has strengthened. In fiscal year 2015, the U.S. government provided UNICEF with more than $77 million to support its humanitarian efforts. UNICEF also works with the U.S. government on a number of global health initiatives. These include ensuring that every child is fully immunized and preventing HIV transmission from mother to child. UNICEF also works with the U.S. government on the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\nThrough PEPFAR, the U.S. government has invested more than $80 billion to combat global HIV/AIDS since 2003. PEPFAR is a cornerstone of U.S. global health efforts, and it is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease. The program provides 11 million people in over 50 countries with lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, and has contributed to a 40 percent decline in AIDS-related deaths since 2004. In fiscal year 2017, the U.S. contributed $4.2 billion to PEPFAR.\n\nChildren born with HIV and AIDS in Africa, including those living in remote rural areas, can now receive treatment. PEPFAR is working to ensure that every child is tested, identified, and started on treatment. New initiatives are also helping to treat HIV-positive mothers and prevent them from passing the virus on to their unborn children.\n\nIn the five years since the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was launched, more than 40 countries have invested in the development of a National Emergency and Medical Preparedness and Response Plan. To date, more than 15 countries have published plans. In 2016, the GHSA received a boost when the U.S. committed to invest $1.3 billion through 2020. This funding will support the purchase of 50 million doses of vaccines to help save lives from infectious diseases like]" time="3.109"><properties><property name="score" value="0.671850194533666" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[1.

I am a huge fan of using Twitter as a marketing tool, even more than Facebook. It\u2019s a great way to network and reach out to people who are interested in what you have to offer. Here is my list of 10 tips to help you promote anything you are selling on Twitter:\n\n1. Use Hashtags\n\nI love using hashtags on Twitter. They help to promote the things you are interested in and create a sense of community within a group. I will admit that it can be hard to remember hashtags to use for all the things you promote. One way I suggest to overcome this is to put your hashtags in a Twitter search to make sure they are not already being used. This will save you some time and help you avoid any issues down the road.\n\n2. Retweet\n\nIf you like a tweet, retweet it! I\u2019m sure most people are familiar with the concept of retweeting, but I just wanted to put it out there to make sure it was stated. Retweeting is a great way to share the things you like, and can be a great way to show your audience that you are involved in the social media community and help them feel more comfortable doing business with you.\n\n3. Mention\n\nMentioning someone on Twitter is a great way to show your audience that you are engaged and want to interact with them. It is important to mention other people within your field of interest in order to show your audience that you are well connected. I always make sure to mention people who have liked or retweeted my stuff as well. It makes me feel good when I get a mention and it shows that the people I engage with are interested in what I have to say.\n\n4. Post About Your Daily Life\n\nThere is nothing wrong with posting about your daily life and about other stuff you like. I\u2019m sure you all know about the Twitter feeds that are all business. I don\u2019t like following people like that because I feel like it takes away from the idea of the social aspect of Twitter. By being a person and talking about your life, you can show your audience that you are a real person and are interested in other people\u2019s lives as well. I\u2019m sure you have seen some tweets about people\u2019s lives that you thought were really cool, and the people that posted those tweets have engaged you because of it.\n\n5. Be Social\n\nDon\u2019t forget to be social. I\u2019m sure that when you first started out you didn\u2019t know what to do on Twitter. My suggestion to you is to find some people who are interested in the things you are and start a conversation. You will see that the conversations that start on Twitter are real and can be interesting. One of my favorite things to do on Twitter is to start conversations with people. It gives me the chance to learn from other people and also helps them learn about me.\n\n6. Use Pictures\n\nI love using pictures on Twitter. I know a lot of people like to include pictures when they post about things, and I would like to suggest that you do so as well. Including a picture with your tweet can get you more retweets and likes, and can really help to boost the effectiveness of your post. I like to use pictures from Instagram with my tweets, but you can really use any picture. If you want to make a picture of yourself that has an impact on your audience, I would suggest using a tool like Socialbakers.\n\n7. Use Hashtags That Make Sense\n\nI\u2019ve touched on this before, but I want to emphasize it again. It is important to make sure that you are using hashtags that make sense. You don\u2019t want to hashtag your tweets with irrelevant hashtags just to get a retweet or a like. You also don\u2019t want to make hashtags that are too long. I would suggest keeping your hashtags short and relevant.\n\n8. Direct Message\n\nThere are times when a DM is more appropriate than a tweet. You will be surprised at how many people DM you. I think a lot of people just use it to ask questions, but you can also use it to network. I think a lot of people don\u2019t use DMs because they don\u2019t think their audience will see it. If you are going to send a DM, make sure it is personal. Send it to someone who is following you. It\u2019s a lot less likely that they will check the people they follow to see who is sending them a DM, so if you DM a person that is following you, they are much more likely to respond.\n\n9. Use Images\n\nI want to encourage you to use images with your tweets. Images are the first thing people look at, so you want to make sure that you are using good images. One thing I like to do is to include images with my tweets. I\u2019m sure you have seen a lot of Twitter profiles that do this. It helps to keep your tweets interesting and make your tweets more unique.\n\n10. Be You\n\nThis last one is really important. You want to be yourself on Twitter. The more genuine you are, the better. People can see through a fake personality. You want to engage with your audience and show them who you are. When they see you as a real person, it will help to build a more trusting relationship between you and your audience.\n\nThere you have it!

First of all, you're expected to wear a hideous dress that you've never worn before. Second, you're required to spend your evening catering to everyone else, acting as the host of the event. Most importantly, however, you're required to smile a lot and appear happy.\n\nAt the wedding I attended, everyone was happy, especially the bride and groom. I was happy for them, but I wasn't the happiest bridesmaid in the crowd. In fact, I was the exact opposite.\n\nWhy was I so unhappy? I wasn't the one getting married; I was the maid of honor. I was so annoyed that I was even standing up for my ex. We'd broken up last month because I thought he was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer. I was at the wedding because my best friend Alicia insisted that I go, but if she knew how much I hated the groom, she would have probably asked me not to go at all.\n\nAnyway, this was the part of the wedding that was pissing me off: the proposal. I was trying my hardest to hold back my tears, but I was failing. I didn't love him anymore, and I never would again.\n\nI glanced over at my ex-boyfriend, Blake. He was really handsome, but that's not what was important right now. He was going down on one knee and was about to propose to the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.\n\n&quot;Andi, will you marry me?&quot;\n\nI cringed. He'd asked me the same question about ten times, but I was too busy being angry at him to remember. This time was different, however, because he was now asking the blonde bimbo he was sleeping with.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, finally accepting the proposal.\n\nAs soon as he slid the ring on her finger, everyone in the room erupted into cheers. I just stood there, my mouth wide open, in complete shock.\n\n&quot;Yes, that's my girl,&quot; said Blake, &quot;And now she's my fianc\xe9e!&quot;\n\nAs they walked out of the church and into the limo, Blake leaned over and kissed her cheek. A couple seconds later, I lost it.\n\n&quot;Bastard,&quot; I muttered. &quot;Bastard.&quot;\n\n&quot;Andrea?&quot; said Alicia.\n\n&quot;He just asked that whore to marry him,&quot; I said. &quot;It was my turn. I was the one who should have been there. I'm the one who was supposed to marry him!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, well I know that,&quot; she said, rolling her eyes. &quot;But it's over now. You just have to be a big girl and accept it.&quot;\n\n&quot;He doesn't love her,&quot; I said, &quot;I know it. He was with her while he was with me, remember?&quot;\n\n&quot;Andi, I hate to say this, but it's too late now,&quot; she said. &quot;He's getting married. You can't do anything about it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I could show up at the wedding,&quot; I said, &quot;and say that I'm his girlfriend and I'm pregnant.&quot;\n\n&quot;Andi, that's insane,&quot; she said. &quot;You know it's not your baby. You're going to destroy his wedding day if you pull something like that.&quot;\n\n&quot;That's the point,&quot; I said. &quot;I want him to feel the way I feel. I want him to feel miserable for a change.&quot;\n\n&quot;Look,&quot; she said, &quot;I'll go with you, but you can't tell Blake anything. If you do, you're going to be the biggest loser in the room, and you're going to lose your best friend.&quot;\n\nI hesitated. I knew she was right. If I ruined the wedding, I'd be in a lot of trouble.\n\n&quot;Fine,&quot; I said. &quot;I won't tell him anything.&quot;\n\nA few days later, I arrived at the church. The doors were open, so I wandered in. The church was completely empty, which made it look a lot bigger. I could hear some talking coming from the altar, so I walked in that direction. The first person I saw was Blake, wearing a brand new suit and looking like the happiest man on the planet.\n\n&quot;You look so beautiful,&quot; he said to the blonde bimbo who stood next to him.\n\nI thought I would be furious when I saw her, but I wasn't. I was heartbroken and sad, but I didn't hate her. In fact, I didn't feel anything towards her. I was just jealous, and the sight of her made me remember how much I'd wanted to marry Blake myself.\n\nI walked up the aisle, ignoring the fact that I was completely alone. I sat down in the front row, and began to think about what had happened.\n\n&quot;How did it happen?&quot; I said to myself. &quot;Why did we break up?&quot;\n\nI knew that I loved him, but I was certain he didn't love me. My best friend Alicia and I had discussed it, and she agreed with me. She was convinced that Blake was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer, but I wasn't convinced.\n\n&quot;It can't be her,&quot; I said. &quot;How did he meet her? Where did they meet?&quot;\n\nJust then, a woman walked up to the front of the church. She was dressed in a black robe, and she had short, black hair.\n\n&quot;Are you Andrea?&quot; she asked.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;but the wedding has been cancelled.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;Blake is getting married in Las Vegas,&quot; she said.\n\n&quot;But I'm his fianc\xe9e,&quot; I said, &quot;And I'm supposed to be here.&quot;\n\n&quot;You were never his fianc\xe9e,&quot; she said. &quot;The bimbo, Summer, is the one he's getting married to.&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't understand.&quot;\n\n&quot;Neither do I,&quot; she said, &quot;but I was supposed to tell you the wedding was cancelled. So, that's what I'm doing. Sorry for ruining your night.&quot;\n\n&quot;It's okay,&quot; I said. &quot;It's not your fault.&quot;\n\nI knew I had to get out of there. I could barely stand being there as it was, so I hurried out the door. I walked down the sidewalk, not knowing where I was going. I had no idea what to do next.\n\n&quot;Hey,&quot; said a voice behind me.\n\nI turned around and saw Blake running towards me.\n\n&quot;You were supposed to be at the wedding,&quot; he said. &quot;Where have you been?&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm not going to lie to you,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm really hurt, and I don't want to be in your wedding. I'm just here because your father paid for the wedding.&quot;\n\n&quot;You don't understand,&quot; he said. &quot;We're getting married in Las Vegas tonight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Really?&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;Andi, we've got to go,&quot; he said, &quot;it's going to start any second.&quot;\n\nI took one look at his face, and I knew that he was telling the truth. I felt the tears well up in my eyes.\n\n&quot;So, this is it?&quot; I said. &quot;You're really getting married?&quot;\n\n&quot;Andi, I'm sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't know how to tell you. My father forced me into this, and I couldn't say no. If I had it my way, you'd be my wife right now. But this is the way it has to be.&quot;\n\nI felt a tear escape my eye, and I quickly wiped it away.\n\n&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;I'm not going,&quot; I]" time="4.205"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9917177217347282" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[IMG_2720\n\nJune 26, 2018.

In an interview with Josh Radnor from earlier this year, he claimed he would only do a spin-off if it was centered around Ted and Barney, with the two of them going off to some far off place (New Zealand? Australia?) where they lived in a beach house and watched sports. I laughed. A lot. And now that I have come up with a sequel for The Only Person Who Didn't Run from Ted Mosby, I don't really have a plot for it...\n\n(Disclaimer: This is a work of fan fiction. Any resemblance to any other work of fiction is entirely coincidental. Not to mention a little insulting)\n\nI sat on my bed, looking down at my phone. There was only one person who could help me write this...\n\nI knew it was kind of a lame excuse. I mean, my sister works at a museum, for Pete's sake. She can't help me with a stupid paper. What was I thinking? And I had a really good excuse to tell my girlfriend when I get home. We had a date. But, in order to give me that good excuse, I have to write this stupid paper and get it done. I have to talk to my sister.\n\nI dialed the number to my sister's work, and it started ringing. My sister, Gloria, picked up.\n\n&quot;What's up, D?&quot;\n\n&quot;Glor, do you think you can help me with a paper? I really need some help.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure.

I need to know how to start a paper.&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm glad you asked.&quot;\n\nAnd I was off to a good start. I sat at my desk, making notes. The paper was going to be really easy to write. It would probably only take a couple hours. I knew it. And I would be home before Lily.\n\nThe paper was starting to look really good. I had a bibliography in place, a couple of good paragraphs, and a nice introduction. Everything was great.\n\nI had a paper ready to turn in the next morning. It was almost done, and I was free to go home. But I had a date to get to.\n\n&quot;Bartender!&quot; I called. &quot;One more, please!&quot;\n\n&quot;You sure, man? You're not gonna make it home tonight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Nah, man. It's all good. I'll just be getting home, like, ten minutes later than I would.&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay, man. Whatever you say.&quot;\n\nI started walking out the door, but I took the bar stool with me. I had to carry it around to make it look like I was in a drunken stupor. If my girlfriend saw that I was drunk when I got home, I would never be able to keep my secret.\n\nAs I made my way through the train station, I heard a strange beeping sound. I turned my head to the side, trying to find the source of the noise. It was coming from my phone. There was a text message. I opened my phone, and read it.\n\nI was starting to feel a little tipsy. It was a good thing I was carrying a bar stool around. It made me look like I had a reason for not walking right.\n\nThe message was from Lily. I read it.\n\nThe good thing about living in New York was the night life. I was lucky enough to be able to spend an evening at a nightclub, so I would be home in no time.\n\n&quot;Yeah, man,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't know why I even did this, dude.&quot;\n\nI walked out of the nightclub and back into the train station. I knew it was late, but the train wasn't too crowded. I sat down in a seat, trying to get some sleep. I would be home soon enough.\n\nI woke up as the train pulled into the station. I was close to home now. It was getting a little crowded on the train, but I managed to squeeze myself into the seat.

I made my way through the crowd, out into the parking lot, and across the street to my car. I put the bar stool in the trunk, and got in the car. I turned on the engine, and drove off.\n\n&quot;Hey, Lily. Yeah, I'm on my way home. I'm sorry, but I ran into some trouble. It shouldn't take me long to get home.&quot;\n\n&quot;You said that you were just going to be a few minutes late. You said you were on your way home, and then you don't show up for three hours.

John McCain, the maverick Republican whose war record and outspokenness against abuses of power made him an American icon, died on Saturday. He was 81.In a statement, McCain\u2019s office said he died at 4:28 pm local time at the family\u2019s home in Arizona surrounded by family members. The cause of death was not immediately known.The former Navy pilot, who was imprisoned and tortured during the Vietnam War, rose to the top of American politics after emerging as a prominent critic of President Donald Trump.An upstart presidential bid in 2000 did not succeed but after he won the Republican nomination in 2008, he lost to Democrat Barack Obama.Despite the loss, his image soared and he emerged as one of the most influential members of the Senate, willing to work with Democrats on issues like campaign finance reform.By the time he ran for president again in 2016, he seemed like a throwback to a bygone era of civility and bipartisanship. McCain ran against Obama again in 2008.He continued to play a pivotal role in American politics, becoming chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee after the Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2015.McCain in the past had been a thorn in the side of Republican presidents \u2014 George W. Bush and Trump.He was also well known for reaching across the aisle.He took a secret trip to visit Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad during the early years of the country\u2019s civil war, and was one of the final Republicans to speak with the president before his firing last year.He was a long-time critic of the U.S. use of torture against detainees.He held out against Republicans\u2019 efforts to dismantle Obama\u2019s signature healthcare legislation and refused to support the Graham-Cassidy bill last year.He was a harsh critic of Russia, and one of the earliest supporters of sanctions against Russian officials. He played a role in seeking to keep the United States from launching a pre-emptive attack against North Korea in the face of its nuclear provocations.McCain was one of the first Republicans to support Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016. But when the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape emerged, he withdrew his support, and famously said in his 2017 memoir \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d \u201cI do not know how I could have spoken so disrespectfully about the commander in chief of the Armed Forces.\u201dHe also repeatedly denounced what he called Trump\u2019s \u201ccheap rhetoric and insults\u201d against U.S. allies, and after Trump\u2019s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2018, called it a \u201ctragic mistake.\u201d He was one of the loudest Republican voices criticizing the president for his performance at a summit with Putin in Helsinki.Trump mocked him as \u201ca clown,\u201d and even at the end of his life, he was still a target for the president, who reportedly resisted hosting a state funeral.On Saturday, Trump said he sent his \u201cdeepest sympathies and respect\u201d to McCain\u2019s family.\u201cThe nation mourns the loss of a great American patriot, a statesman who put his country first and enriched this nation every day he served.\u201dFormer President Barack Obama called him a \u201cgiant of American politics,\u201d and his one-time opponent in the 2008 presidential race said he was \u201ca man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order.\u201dPresidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, called McCain \u201can American hero\u201d on Twitter.McCain\u2019s funeral service will be held at the Washington National Cathedral and the ceremony will include eulogies from former President George W. Bush, former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Sen. Joe Lieberman, the former vice-presidential candidate who was a close friend.After the service, he will be buried in Annapolis, Md., at the U.S. Naval Academy.McCain was born at a naval station in the Panama Canal Zone, where his father was stationed. After his father\u2019s career in the Navy, the family settled in the Arizona desert, where he attended high school.McCain studied at the Naval Academy and became a pilot in the Navy, serving on a ship that was shot down in Vietnam. He spent five-and-a-half years in captivity, which included torture, before he was released in 1973.McCain returned to the U.S. and was assigned to the Senate as a liaison to the Navy. He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1983 and eventually the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce.During his 2008 presidential bid, he secured the GOP nomination in the face of much skepticism. At a dinner in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama joked that after losing to Obama, McCain would be on a beach sipping a drink with \u201can umbrella in it.\u201dThe Republican-led Senate, which was much closer to McCain than to the president, overwhelmingly passed a resolution earlier this year that censured Trump for his \u201cbigoted and racist\u201d remarks about four members of Congress.In his memoir, McCain said that he regretted that his choice of Sarah Palin as a running mate did not propel him to the White House. He said he made the choice based on who he thought could become president, but that was wrong.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

Playback was left running until power draw converged to a stable value.\n\nCooling modern video cards is becoming more and more difficult, especially when users are asking for quiet cooling solutions. That's why the engineers are now paying much more attention to power consumption of new video-card designs.For this test, we measured the power consumption of the graphics card only via the PCI-Express power connector(s) and PCI-Express bus slot. A Keithley Integra 2700 digital multimeter with 6.5-digit resolution was used for all measurements. Again, the values here reflect only the power consumption of the card measured at DC VGA card inputs, not of the whole system.We choseas a standard test representing typical 3D gaming usage because it offers the following: very high power draw; high repeatability; is a current game that is supported on all cards because of its DirectX 9 roots; drivers are actively tested and optimized for it; supports all multi-GPU configurations; test runs in a relatively short time and renders a non-static scene with variable complexity.To measure the power consumption of our testbed we used a digital power meter (Keithley Integra 2700) connected before the power supply. The power consumption measurement of the system is based on the power consumption of the drives, not of the graphics cards. All cards were tested with a total of four SSDs: one in the system, one used as a primary test drive in a slot without a powered connector, and two additional drives in the system (not used for testing). The SSDs are Western Digital WD360GD (362GB), WD1500HLHX (150GB), Samsung SSD 830 (128GB) and OCZ Agility 3 (240GB).Idle power consumption of the whole test system (at the desktop) is measured after sitting idle at the desktop for 30 minutes. The cards are not closed. The result is presented as the average value of all four cards.Please note that after extensive testing, we found that measuring idle power consumption only, as seen in many other reviews, can be misleading. Due to different testing methodology and environments, this number can be significantly lower than the real power consumption. Also, in many cases, the card does not reach the desired idle temperature, so it will draw more power. In our test setup, the cards reach their idle temperature very quickly (in a few minutes) and in a climate controlled room (22\xb0C).Therefore, we use this only as a rough indication of the cards' power consumption.Please note we are using different adjustements to test the performance of our graphics cards. Our testing methodology is detailed here . It's worth mentioning that our method allows us to perform a more thorough test that's free from GPU bottlenecks. It's also free from variations caused by dual-gpu/hybrid configurations.The following two values are the peak power consumption and the maximum power consumption of our testbed (without speakers/headphones) measured after long periods of use (at least 15 minutes) with Windows Aero enabled. The peak power consumption is the maximum power draw of the graphics card only, measured in the most stressful situation (generally, when it's overclocked). The maximum power consumption is the maximum power draw of the complete testbed, including the monitor, speakers, hard-disk, SSD, etc.The results are impressive. Idle power consumption is a tiny bit higher than that of the GTX 580. All cards operate at fairly low power levels in idle. NVIDIA has done a good job reducing idle power consumption of its GTX 680. Under full load, the GTX 680 is only slightly more power hungry than the GTX 580. Compared to AMD, the GTX 680 fares even better as it uses slightly less power than the HD 7970.All graphics cards tested consume quite a lot of power during Blu-ray playback. Interestingly, this is one area where NVIDIA can't keep up with AMD.]" time="2.669"><properties><property name="score" value="0.6072969913482666" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.60729699&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.60729699

He was a descendant of John Kearney (1635\u20131701), a native of Ireland who was the first of the family to settle in what became the United States. John's son Richard (1668\u20131734) was born in Bristol, England, but became a fur trader in what was then the English colonies and later became New Jersey. Richard was commissioned as an ensign by British colonial governor Jonathan Belcher in 1709.\n\nRichard's son James (1703\u20131785) was a general in the New Jersey colonial militia during the French and Indian War. James's son Stephen Watts Kearny, the namesake of the general, was a captain in the War of Independence and was at the surrender of General John Burgoyne. His home, the Kearney Mansion, has since been preserved in Newark.\n\nIn 1794 he moved with his parents to Louisville, Kentucky. His father, Alexander Morris Kearney, a native of South Carolina, was a captain in the American Revolutionary War. In the War of 1812, Kearney participated in the Battle of Lundy's Lane, where he was wounded and captured by the British. After being released, he joined the Missouri Rangers and, in 1813, married Mary Radcliffe Matthews. In 1814 he joined the 5th United States Infantry as its sixth lieutenant and served in the war against the Creek nation. In 1819 he was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry. Kearney resigned from the Army in 1822 and became superintendent of Indian affairs at St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn 1832 Kearney was appointed as governor of the New Mexico Territory, where he was active in promoting settlement and negotiating treaties with the Native Americans. Kearney participated in the Gila Expedition of 1837 and then commanded the Army's Third Dragoon Regiment in Florida in 1837 and 1838.\n\nDuring the Mexican\u2013American War, Kearney was appointed colonel of the 1st New York Dragoons on June 30, 1846. Kearney's new regiment was sent to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to reinforce the Army of New Mexico under Col. Stephen Watts Kearny (no relation). There they joined the march on the capital of Mexico City. On the way, Kearney's regiment carried out several successful raids, including the Battle of La Mesa, where he captured a large amount of ammunition and supplies. He took the Puebla de Los Angeles without opposition on December 7, 1846. There he received word that his promotion to brigadier general had been approved.\n\nKearny, reinforced by the 3rd Infantry and Mormon Battalion, took the city of Monterrey on September 25, 1846. During the battle, a cannonball tore away part of Kearny's jaw and neck.\n\nFollowing the battle, Kearney was carried to Saltillo for medical treatment. While he was recovering, Lt. Colonel John Garland was given command of the 1st Dragoons. In February 1847, Kearney returned to the army and resumed command of the dragoons. Kearney served in the Battle of Buena Vista, and later he fought in the Taos Revolt. He returned to the United States in October 1847 and was assigned to Fort Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory.\n\nKearney, a bachelor, died of cholera at Fort Leavenworth at the age of 54.

According to the World Health Organization, &quot;in countries with very low fertility, the proportion of young people may halve in the next 40 years&quot;. At this rate, by 2100 a majority of the world's population will be over 50. We will then have to find a way to accommodate the needs and aspirations of an unprecedented number of very old people in a society that has been moulded for decades around the needs of youth.\n\nNowhere is this more true than in Japan, the world's fastest-ageing country. The greying of Japan \u2013 &quot;silver tsunami&quot; or &quot;grey goo&quot; as it is known \u2013 is by now well known. There are a number of reasons for this. Japanese have one of the longest life expectancies in the world, with women expected to live to 87 and men to 80. Meanwhile, a long-standing national emphasis on having small families and long working hours \u2013 for both men and women \u2013 have kept the birth rate below replacement levels. And Japan's postwar economic miracle has not been kind to the young. The country's population is shrinking, partly because of a low birth rate and partly because of a high level of immigration.\n\nBut what is less well known is that this graying of Japan \u2013 and other nations such as Germany, China, South Korea and Thailand \u2013 is not just due to longer life expectancy and lower birth rates. There is another factor in play, and one that could have dramatic implications: very low fertility rates, particularly among younger women. It's estimated that around a quarter of the population will be aged over 65 by 2050.\n\nIn Japan, the &quot;total fertility rate&quot; (the number of children a woman is likely to have in her lifetime) is just 1.4 \u2013 and has been for the past 20 years. Among women aged between 15 and 24, the rate is even lower at 0.8, lower even than the famously low rate in Germany (which is 1.38). And in Tokyo, that rate is even lower at 0.7. By contrast, in 2010, the average rate in Europe was 1.6. The fertility rate in England and Wales in 2010 was 1.9.\n\nThe world's media are full of breathless stories about Japan's crisis of depopulation. Last year, an article in the International Business Times said that &quot;Japanese women are rejecting marriage and motherhood at a staggering rate&quot;. In the New York Times, another piece claimed that Japan is &quot;exporting its young women&quot; and is now &quot;facing a demographic crisis of epic proportions&quot;. More soberly, the BBC's business editor Robert Peston has written: &quot;Without a dramatic increase in its birth rate, Japan will face economic and social ruin.&quot;\n\nThe sense of panic is understandable. &quot;The number of young people will go down by two-thirds by 2035,&quot; says demographer Toshio Kanazawa. &quot;That means not only a decline in the size of the workforce but a dramatic increase in the number of retirees. Who will pay for them?&quot;\n\nThe answer is &quot;women&quot; \u2013 or more specifically, their wombs. And in this, there is something not quite right.\n\nIn Tokyo, I meet Nana, a 29-year-old who is employed in the financial sector. She is smartly dressed in a suit and speaks good English. She tells me she has a boyfriend and they are very happy. She is, she says, the typical &quot;She Economy&quot; \u2013 a young woman working in the city and her parents are very pleased. &quot;They want me to settle down,&quot; she says, &quot;and have children.&quot; But she's not so sure.\n\n&quot;It's too late,&quot; she says. &quot;I've got to think of my future. And I just don't know if I could afford it \u2013 having children. I'd need a bigger flat, and pay for childcare, and a new car.&quot;\n\nFor Nana, and for many Japanese women like her, the economic reality of having children is daunting. &quot;I have two brothers,&quot; she says, &quot;and they have wives and children. The wives don't work, and they have one or two children. One of my sisters-in-law doesn't even work outside the house. They don't have much money, but my parents love them. They are very happy. So I know what my parents want for me. But it's impossible. I can't do it.&quot;\n\nThis is a scenario that is playing out in homes across the country. The situation is, in many respects, rather unique. As Peston points out, Japanese women who stay in employment tend to have children later. As a result, while there is a generation of Japanese in their early 30s who have given up on having children, there is a generation of younger women who are still trying to get pregnant.\n\n&quot;I think it's pretty much impossible to have two or three children in Tokyo,&quot; says Seiko, a 35-year-old marketing executive. &quot;I don't think I could afford it. You have to pay so much for childcare. And then, you've got to give up work. I just couldn't do it.\n\n&quot;But, still, my mother is pressuring me to have children. If you have a boyfriend, you can't get married. It's impossible. You have to marry first, then have children. So, if you are a working woman, you have to get married, have children, and then stay at home with your children. That's it. And that's what everyone wants. That's the ideal.&quot;\n\nAt the root of this ideal is Japan's traditional gender-role society \u2013 one that has stayed remarkably the same since the end of the second world war. It is not, perhaps, surprising that such a rigid society is under strain. And not only for women. It is also under strain for men.\n\n&quot;Women in Japan are not treated well,&quot; says Toshio Kanazawa. &quot;They don't earn a lot of money. They are discriminated against in many ways. That's why there aren't enough babies.&quot;\n\nNot everyone agrees. &quot;I don't think it's true,&quot; says Nana, who, I've noticed, has referred to herself as &quot;boku&quot; (which means &quot;I&quot;) all evening, rather than the more feminine &quot;watashi&quot; (which means &quot;I&quot;). &quot;Women in Japan are strong. They do well at work and they earn a lot of money. They can do everything. So why should they have children?&quot;\n\nIn some respects, Nana has a point. Japan is a country in which young women are breaking glass ceilings. The number of women in senior management in Japan's 3,000 largest companies is at a record high. And in 2013, the World Economic Forum rated Japan the fourth most &quot;gender-equal&quot; nation in the world.\n\nThe Japanese government has encouraged this development. Ever since the Second World War, successive prime ministers have tried to get more women into the workplace and have even gone so far as to tell men to &quot;say goodbye to their bonuses if they refuse to let their wives and daughters work outside the home&quot;.\n\nBut while some Japanese women are finding their way into senior positions, many are also facing a harsh reality: most large Japanese corporations have an unofficial &quot;marriage bar&quot; that prohibits the promotion of women who are married and have children. This is particularly true of men. According to a study by the Japanese government, 61.5 per cent of male managers are married. By contrast, only 42.2 per cent of female managers are married. This means that women with children can be in a very difficult position, because \u2013 as Shihoko Goto of the Wilson Center points out \u2013 they face a choice between marriage and career. And that is not a choice that men face.\n\n&quot;If you look at people in their 30s,&quot; says Seiko, &quot;I think many of them are not getting married and having children. If you don't have children, you have more time and money to enjoy your life. So why not?\n\n&quot;I don't think that women are rejecting marriage and family,&quot; she says. &quot;It's just that if you want children and you are a career woman, it's impossible. There is no way. You can't do both. And so you have to make a choice. Either you go for your career or you go for marriage and family. That's what I think is happening.&quot;\n\n&quot;In Japan,&quot; says Goto, &quot;it's very difficult for men and women to be able to balance work and family. So, if you are a career woman, you will have to sacrifice family. That's the problem. That's why so many women don't have children. Because they want to focus on their career.&quot;\n\nThis is a view echoed by Ai Kato, a 29-year-old tax accountant. &quot;It's true that if you work in a large Japanese company, you cannot get married or have children if you want to keep your job,&quot; she says. &quot;That's the reality. It's a matter of the company culture. It's difficult to balance both. And so people are having fewer children.&quot;\n\nJapan has never really known anything else. &quot;Since the Meiji era [from 1868 to 1912] Japan's population has been very stable,&quot; says Kanazawa. &quot;So they think that is normal. But it's not. If you look at Germany, their population is falling too, but they are getting immigrants. And in the US and the UK, the population is stable, but people are having more children. So there are many different types of demographic change, and Japan is one of the most extreme.&quot;\n\nWhat is less clear is why this is happening. The popular explanation is that Japan is a victim of the phenomenon known as the &quot;demographic time bomb&quot; or &quot;]" time="4.968"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9821796351008945" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Australian Computer Emergency Response Team\n\nThe Australian Computer Emergency Response Team (AusCERT) is the recognised national computer security incident response team of the Australian Government.

He was released on strict house arrest conditions on February 1, 2006, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that his detention was unconstitutional.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too far fetched to say that Bruce is the Scottish version of Neil Buchanan in American Psycho. Not necessarily in terms of the content of the story, but in the sheer fact that he is a very messed up guy, one who people can\u2019t stand, but at the same time can\u2019t stop looking at him.\n\nThis character is played to perfection by Jonny Lee Miller in the new film adaptation of Filth. The novel follows Bruce Robertson (Miller) a detective who, after starting the story off as a drunken, bitter asshole, finds out that he has cancer and so takes leave to get himself checked out. This action in turn leads to Bruce discovering that he is actually a massive pervert. He becomes obsessed with performing the most unspeakable of actions in order to be like the perverts that he so despises. The film follows Bruce as he conducts an investigation to find the person responsible for him being a terrible person and while he is still struggling with his illness.\n\nWhat is great about this adaptation is that it keeps the nastiness and the gritty, unpleasant content that is in the book. That might be what stops this film from being a complete success because this film is a difficult watch. It\u2019s not so difficult because of the content but because you will be so incredibly frustrated by the main character. He is an unpleasant person who you don\u2019t want to spend time with.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to Miller\u2019s performance that he makes you want to keep watching even though you can\u2019t stand him. It\u2019s this nastiness that he exudes that makes him so engaging to watch. You will want to know how his investigation turns out and what his next move is, because he is truly awful. It also helps that he looks incredibly creepy, like he would kill someone at the slightest provocation.\n\nBruce is helped by a fantastic supporting cast. Jon Skellern plays Bruce\u2019s best friend Simon. You can tell that Simon has his concerns for Bruce and that his concern for him will only continue to grow as Bruce\u2019s behaviour becomes worse. Simon acts as the voice of reason when it comes to Bruce and does his best to help him, only to be shut down by Bruce\u2019s barbs and by Bruce himself. Kelly Macdonald plays Bruce\u2019s wife Susan. While Bruce gets into scrapes with his fellow detectives, Susan is struggling to cope with him and his illness. It\u2019s obvious that Susan is struggling with her husband\u2019s condition, and you will feel for her throughout the film.\n\nThere are a lot of big names in this film that will be recognisable to most people. Jonny Lee Miller, so good as Sherlock Holmes, plays Bruce with a brilliant blend of ferocity and uncertainty. While he is fully committed to the disgusting nature of his character, he also seems like he could completely lose it at any minute. Stephen Fry is outstanding as Inspector Siobhan Clarke, who is one of the few people who is able to make Bruce think twice about the things he does. Everyone is perfectly cast and help to make this film feel incredibly authentic.\n\nThe film does do a good job of adapting the book. Although the source material is sometimes over the top, the film takes that feeling and amplifies it to the next level. What is great about this film is that you do believe that all the characters are real people.

I just spent about two hours on CSPAN watching the Committee's hearings about Puerto Rico. Not once was the possibility of debt restructuring, which would mean debt reduction, mentioned. All that was mentioned was higher taxes, pension cuts, and deep government spending cuts, on top of what Puerto Rico is already doing. A complete deadlock. Puerto Rico has been austerity-impaired for a long time now, and has experienced a 12% drop in GDP as a result. No one can grow their way out of debt. Yet, even with this depression-like economy, Puerto Rico is still paying a huge amount of its income to its creditors. A lot of that debt comes from bonds that the government of Puerto Rico sold to investors to get the money to cover the huge losses that its electricity monopoly incurred because of oil price spikes. The government still has no way to fix that, since electricity is now being generated by private companies, due to a privatization law passed in 2013. The government of Puerto Rico could offer a debt exchange to investors, swapping the current bonds for ones with a longer maturity date and a lower interest rate, and then reinvest the proceeds into infrastructure projects, where it has a big deficit. But that possibility is completely ruled out. On the other side, the creditors are as intransigent as ever. They claim they can sue the US government if it tries to change their contracts, which is not true. They also claim that Puerto Rico is defaulting on its debt already, which is also not true. The government of Puerto Rico has been paying its creditors 100 cents on the dollar. There is simply no default risk. This is all a huge waste of time. All that the Puerto Rico hearings did was show that the US Congress is not capable of doing what it should have done long ago: allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debts. That would have given Puerto Rico a fresh start, and the creditors would have ended up with their money back. And we would have avoided all this useless talking. Now, we are just wasting time and making the situation worse. Puerto Rico's economy continues to decline. Puerto Rico's economy is expected to contract again by at least 1% in 2016, and another 2% in 2017. Most of the business owners I interviewed in Puerto Rico last month said they expect business to get worse in 2017. So the longer the creditors keep Puerto Rico in this situation, the worse it will get. In the hearings today, several senators brought up a resolution that the House of Representatives passed yesterday in a partisan vote, saying that Puerto Rico is already in default. That resolution is just to make a political point. The Supreme Court has already ruled that Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy like a US municipality can, and cannot restructure its debt in a court. This was because of a law that was passed in 1984. The US Congress could have changed this law a long time ago, but they did not. The Republicans in the House of Representatives, however, do not want to restructure Puerto Rico's debts. Instead, they are trying to force the government of Puerto Rico to do all the reforms it already is doing, without giving it the opportunity to do the debt restructuring that will put its economy back on track. This was not really mentioned in the Senate hearings, but I found out from reporters that the Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee are not going to move forward with the House resolution. They understand that it is not going to pass. We need Congress to pass the resolution anyway, just to show that it has bipartisan support. In the House hearings, Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin said, &quot;This is not an emergency.&quot; This is a statement that no one in Puerto Rico agrees with. By delaying the debt restructuring, the economy of Puerto Rico is getting worse. More people are moving to the US mainland, which will further reduce the income that Puerto Rico is able to collect in taxes. More people are being forced to do cash jobs in the underground economy, because they cannot find other jobs. And those jobs do not get reported to the government. The longer this process is delayed, the worse it will get. But the creditors and some members of Congress do not seem to understand that Puerto Rico needs a fresh start. So they will continue to waste time, talking about things that are already being done, without any hope of any positive outcome. Puerto Rico's creditors just don't want to take a loss.

It is not an uncommon story in that many physicians cannot get paid by insurance companies for a variety of reasons. The difference in this story is that this physician not only tried to get paid, but took the insurance company to court to try to get paid.\n\nIt started when a physician sent an invoice to an insurance company for services rendered. The physician was told that the insurance company did not have the funds to pay the invoice and that they would pay the bill at a later date. The physician sent the insurance company a bill every month for about a year until the insurance company stopped communicating. The physician was then advised by a collection agency that if he wanted to be paid, he would have to take the insurance company to court.\n\nThe physician then did just that. He filed a claim with the District Court seeking the unpaid bill plus interest and costs. The insurance company tried to have the case dismissed by claiming the physician did not have standing to sue. The insurance company argued that the physician only had a contractual right to be paid, but that right had not been breached. They also argued that he could not have been damaged by their failure to pay since it was their money.\n\nThe physician won the case. He was awarded the $10,600 plus interest and costs. The judge agreed that the insurance company breached the contract when it failed to pay the bill. The judge also found that the insurance company's withholding of payment did cause the physician to suffer damages in the form of legal fees to pursue payment.\n\nAs for the insurance company, it is probably a good idea that they got caught.

The book is written by Jeremy Spencer, who claims that his grandfather was a cult leader and that his father was in a cult. It is hoped that by publishing this book that Jeremy Spencer can stop this cycle and prevent any other children from being hurt in this way.\n\nA spokesperson for Jeremy Spencer has confirmed that he is desperately in need of some cash to fund the marketing and promotion of the book. The cost is simply too great to risk doing it alone. He hopes that if he can raise enough money to pay for advertising, then he will be able to share his story and help people.\n\nIf Jeremy Spencer can raise enough money for the book, then he will gift it to the person who donates the most money. The donation can be made via the crowdfunding site Kickstarter.com.\n\nDonating to this crowdfunding campaign is likely to have more benefits than simply receiving a copy of the book. You can be part of the book and even get a speaking part in it. This is a great opportunity to help someone with a great story.&quot;\n\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding website that allows you to donate money to people who are trying to raise money for something. In return for your donations, you can receive gifts from the person you are donating to.\n\nWould You Accept A Ridiculously Generous Gift?\n\nA friend of mine contacted me a few months ago to ask if I would consider reviewing a book for them. The book was called Cults Inside Out and the author is called Jeremy Spencer. He has offered to donate the book to the highest bidder.\n\nCults Inside Out is the first of a trilogy and Jeremy Spencer is trying to raise money to self-publish the second book. As part of his plan, Jeremy is offering to donate the book to the highest bidder. The highest bidder is whoever donates the most money to Jeremy's GoFundMe account.\n\nWould you accept a ridiculously generous gift? I decided that I would.\n\nJeremy Spencer is an interesting character. I had never heard of him before and I was sceptical about some of the things that he had to say. Jeremy is a bit of a controversial character and he is no stranger to the press. He is very controversial and he has a history of being sued for libel, but you can find out more about that on his GoFundMe page.\n\nThe book is about cults and how they use manipulation techniques to recruit people into their organisations. The book also talks about the psychology of the cult members and how they get manipulated. There is some fascinating stuff in there and it is an easy read.\n\nThe book starts with the stories of two children who were born into cults. One child was the son of a cult leader and the other child was the daughter of another cult leader. Both children were exposed to extreme forms of cult abuse and you can really feel the pain that they went through.\n\nI didn't really enjoy reading the stories of the two children because it was so sad. You could really feel their pain. I am glad that Jeremy was able to escape the cult, but I don't think that it is an easy thing to do. There are always going to be repercussions, no matter how many years later.\n\nAfter the stories of the two children, Jeremy goes on to talk about the psychology of the cult members. I didn't realise that there were so many different reasons why people join cults. There are a number of factors that can influence the decision to join a cult.\n\nThere are a number of strategies that cults use to recruit new members and Jeremy goes on to discuss the techniques that they use. He talks about how they use manipulation and persuasion techniques to encourage people to join them. Jeremy is not the first person to talk about these strategies, but he does explain them in a very clear way.\n\nJeremy also talks about the different kinds of cults and what they are like. There are religious cults and political cults and there are even business cults. There are all kinds of cults and it is fascinating to read about how they are structured and what they are all about.\n\nJeremy Spencer has also included information about his family and his time in the cult. I have never been in a cult, so I don't know what it is like, but I was impressed with how well Jeremy handled the subject. He didn't talk about the cult in a negative way and he didn't try to make it sound worse than it was.\n\nThere is a lot of information about cults in this book and Jeremy doesn't try to overstate any of the facts. He doesn't try to talk in hyperbole and he gives very factual descriptions of what it is like to be in a cult.\n\nIf you are a fan of cults, then this book is going to be right up your street. If you are just interested in psychology, then this book is also going to be right up your street. There are a lot of interesting theories and a lot of fascinating facts.\n\nThere are a number of interesting stories and you can really feel the emotion in this book. I am glad that I have read it, but I don't think that I will read the rest of the trilogy.\n\nWhat you will get if you make the highest bid\n\nIf you make the highest bid on Jeremy's GoFundMe page, then he will send you a copy of Cults Inside Out. The money that you donate will be used to help with the marketing and promotion of the book.\n\nI have seen people donate large amounts of money to crowdfunding projects, so it is definitely possible. Jeremy is even offering to sign your copy of the book, if you make the highest bid.\n\nThe book is available in paperback and as an e-book. You will also be able to get it in various different languages. It is likely to be available in a number of different countries.\n\nYou can get a signed copy of the book for just $30 and Jeremy has been very generous with his offers. There are some very generous rewards if you can make the highest bid. Jeremy is determined to get this book out and he will give you the opportunity to help him.\n\nIf you are interested in making the highest bid, then click here.

How can you be sure she's comfortable? And what should you do if she says no?\n\nHere's how to handle your first time.\n\nGetting ready for the first time\n\nEven though your first time might be really exciting, you need to remember that having sex for the first time can be really awkward.\n\nThis is especially true if you're nervous, so to make it easier for both of you, try to relax, and make sure you're both feeling comfortable and happy to do it. You don't want to be worrying about whether your partner's enjoying it.\n\nThe best way to do this is to talk about it before you get started. Find out what she expects, and what she doesn't. Try to find out how much she knows about sex. It might seem strange to talk about this, but it will make it easier for you both when you get down to it.\n\nYou can talk about contraception too. Both of you should know how you're going to stop pregnancy happening and what to do if it does.\n\nA lot of guys worry about getting their first time over with, but in fact, the longer you take, the more you'll enjoy it.

You're not sure what to expect.\n\nYou're likely to be worried that you won't know how to do it properly or that you'll be rubbish in bed. But the fact is, it doesn't matter how good you are. All that matters is that you both enjoy it and that you're safe.\n\nYour worries might make you want to rush things and this might make you less sensitive and not as gentle as you should be. This is especially true if you're with a virgin. She'll be more nervous than you, so make sure you take your time and that you both enjoy it.\n\nYou'll know if she's enjoying it if she shows signs of pleasure, like:\n\nmoaning\n\ngetting very wet (this is the most obvious one!)\n\nshe may make noises or say things to let you know she's enjoying it\n\nremember to look for these signs!\n\nFirst time with a girl: the sex\n\nSex for the first time can be really exciting.\n\nWhat if she says no?\n\nIf your first time involves having sex with a girl, there's a chance she might say no. That's normal. It's important to make sure she's happy to do it. It's your responsibility to make sure she's okay with it and you don't want to do anything that might hurt her or make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nEven if she says yes, she might change her mind when the time comes. This can be a little awkward, especially if you've been going out with her for a while and you've had sex before.\n\nIf this happens, try to deal with it like a man. If you want to take it further, tell her you really want to, but you won't if she's not up for it.\n\nIf she wants to stop, you should respect that. It can happen, even if she's wanted to have sex for a while. If you think she might be pregnant, make sure you take care of that too.\n\nThe actual sex\n\nIt's important that you know how to please a girl, but this is especially important the first time. It will help you build your confidence, and it will also help her enjoy sex more.\n\nHow do you please a girl?\n\nWhat most people think about when it comes to pleasing a girl is what feels good for her. But in fact, what feels good for you is important too. It's the only way you can both enjoy yourselves and have a great time.\n\nBe careful to go slowly. If you go too fast, you might scare her or make her uncomfortable.\n\nWhat if you're not having sex with a virgin?\n\nIf you're not having sex with a virgin, it's unlikely that you'll have to worry about losing your virginity. It's more likely that she will lose hers!\n\nWhen you have sex for the first time, it's still important that you take it slow. It might be even more important because you'll need to show her that you can be gentle and caring. This will make sure she feels comfortable with you. It will also make sure that you have a great time too.\n\nIs she ready for sex?\n\nYou need to know when she's ready to have sex. If you rush it, you could end up doing something that she's not ready for. This could make her feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, which could make you feel embarrassed too.\n\nIf you don't think she's ready, you shouldn't go ahead. That's because it might make her feel like she's not good enough.\n\nJust be patient and make sure you're both happy and comfortable.\n\nYou can help her decide when she's ready for sex by asking her. Ask her what she thinks about having sex. If she says no, respect that, and don't push it.\n\nIf she says yes, talk about what you both think. Ask her if she's ready for it and talk about what you both expect. You'll both feel more relaxed if you know what's going to happen and you're both ready for it.\n\nDon't forget, it's important that you're both ready, not just her!\n\nWhat if you're with a virgin?\n\nSex for the first time can be really scary. But remember, you're both in the same boat and you can help each other through it.\n\nIf you're with a virgin, you need to remember that she's not an expert. It will take her a while to get used to sex and you need to give her time. It will help if you make sure you go slowly.\n\nAs you know, she'll be nervous, so you need to make sure she feels comfortable.\n\nSome girls are really confident and they're great at giving directions. But other girls aren't, so if she needs help, you should be there to help her.\n\nHow do you make sure she's ready?\n\nYou might have to talk about it. You might feel like she's pushing you into having sex, but she might not actually be ready for it.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable talking to her, you can find out by looking at her. Does she seem relaxed? Is she making the right noises? Is she happy? If she seems happy, you're probably okay.\n\nMake sure you ask her about contraception too. It's important to keep yourself safe, so make sure you both know how you're going to prevent pregnancy.\n\nWhat if you have problems?\n\nSex for the first time can be really scary for some guys. But the good news is that it doesn't have to be.\n\nWhat if you're having trouble getting an erection?\n\nIf you're having trouble getting an erection, it could be that you're nervous. It could also be that you don't feel ready for sex.\n\nIf it's nerves, you should try to relax. Try to take it slowly. You don't want to scare your partner. If you're not ready for sex, then you need to tell her.\n\nIt might help to talk to her about it first. If you think you're ready, but she isn't, you should respect that. You don't want to make her feel bad or make her regret having sex with you.\n\nIt's important that you're both ready for it and that you both feel comfortable. If you're not ready, don't go through with it.\n\nWhat if it doesn't feel right?\n\nSome guys worry about whether they're doing it right. It can be a bit scary if you don't know what to do.\n\nIt's really important that you talk about it. If you think it's not right, you should ask her.\n\nAnd don't worry too much. There's no right way to have sex. The important thing is that both of you are enjoying it and that you're both safe.\n\nIt's really important that you both make sure you're ready for sex. You don't want to go through with it if she's not ready.\n\nIf you're having sex with a virgin, then you need to be more careful. She might not know what she's doing, so it's important that you tell her what you want. You should also tell her if it doesn't feel right.\n\nWhat if it hurts?\n\nIf you're having sex for the first time, there's a chance that it could hurt. But the good news is that this should only happen the first time. If it happens again, you should get help as soon as possible.\n\nYour partner should tell you if it hurts, so you need to listen to her. You should also be able to tell if it hurts. If you can't, then it's not right.\n\nIf it hurts her, then you need to stop and think about what you're doing. It's important that you both know what feels good and what doesn't.\n\nIf you're not sure what to do, then it might be best to practice with a toy. You can use it to find out what she likes and what she doesn't.\n\n]" time="4.860"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9640485379430983" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Public Bookmark *\n\nJames \u201cBucky\u201d Barnes was born in the dead of night, right at the edge of winter and the approaching storm.

It stars Ajay Devgn and Ayesha Takia in lead roles and Kunal Khemu, Nafisa Ali and Rajpal Yadav in supporting roles. The film is a remake of the American movie &quot;Unfaithful&quot;.\n\nThis movie was an average grosser at the box office.\n\nA middle class girl, Meghna (Ayesha Takia) lives with her divorced mother, Dr. Kamla Tiwari (Reema Lagoo), a well known psychiatrist, and her younger sister in the suburbs of Mumbai. Her parents had divorced when she was just two years old, and she has hardly seen her father, Colonel Rameshwar Prasad (Deepak Shirke), ever since.\n\nRajeev Mathur (Ajay Devgn), a renowned architect, is married to Sheetal (Ayesha Julka), who is the love of Meghna's life. Meghna falls in love with Rajeev, and they become involved in an illicit relationship. One day, while trying to evade Rajeev, Meghna witnesses an incident where her father, whom she had not met for more than twelve years, is found dead at a friend's farmhouse.\n\nShe goes to his funeral and is completely shocked to see Rajeev there. On confronting him, she is told that he and her father were old friends and colleagues. She accepts this, but not before starting to suspect that Rajeev has been trying to get her out of the way in order to take over her father's position. She confronts Rajeev on this, but he insists that this is not the case.\n\nMeghna, unable to bear the thought that her father was killed, decides to investigate on her own. She tracks down one of the servants at the farmhouse, who reveals that her father was shot, and that Rajeev was there, drunk, when it happened. She confronts Rajeev, who admits that he and her father were involved in a fraud, in which they stole money from one of their clients, and faked his death to escape justice. However, Rajeev swears that he has nothing to do with her father's death.\n\nShe believes him, and accepts that she was wrong in suspecting him. While trying to console her, he kisses her. They decide to meet the next day. However, on the way to her meeting with Rajeev, she finds him being confronted by her mother and sister, who saw him leaving their house. Rajeev confesses to them that he and Meghna have been involved in a relationship, but insists that they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAfter much debate, her family decides to agree to the relationship. Rajeev insists that Meghna move in with them, but she is shocked to learn that she is pregnant with his child. She insists that Rajeev take a DNA test to prove that the child is his, and he does so.\n\nHe confesses to her that he was never married to his wife, and had no children. He had always been in love with Meghna, but had not told anyone about it, not even her father. Sheetal had left him for another man, who later divorced her, and Rajeev's father was killed by one of his clients, who then blackmailed him. He promises that they will run away together, but Meghna doesn't believe him.\n\nLater that night, Rajeev is killed, and Meghna is accused of the murder. Dr. Tiwari believes her daughter, and begins to suspect that Sheetal might be the murderer. The police refuse to believe Dr. Tiwari's story, and the family falls apart. Meghna is released, but her mother refuses to see her, and she is forced to live with her uncle and his family.\n\nWhen the child is born, the family is forced to admit that the child does bear a close resemblance to Rajeev. They forgive Meghna and re-accept her. She goes to Rajeev's mother (Nafisa Ali), and tells her that the child is Rajeev's. His mother is grief-stricken, but eventually decides to accept Meghna, and asks her to name the child, since Rajeev was also hers.

From 1853 to 1860 he attended the Shamakhy religious school, and then later at the Shamakhi Muslim Boarding School. In 1862, he studied at the Nizamiyya Madrasah in Ganja. At first, he worked as a teacher, but then he moved to Tiflis where he studied at the Caucasian Muslim Gymnasium from 1864 to 1870. Then he returned to Shamakhi and taught at his old school until 1876, when he left for Tiflis again. In 1877, he moved to Baku and worked as a deputy editor and later as an editor at the &quot;Hayat&quot; newspaper. He lived in Tiflis for a third time from 1878 to 1884, and then returned to Baku, where he established a publishing house named &quot;Abdulgaffar&quot;, which published the first Azerbaijani newspaper &quot;Bakinskiy Listok&quot;. He died in 1889.\n\nRafibeyli is considered the founder of the Azerbaijani novel. He is also the author of numerous plays. His best-known plays include &quot;Mumtaz Khan&quot; (1882), &quot;Seyid Huseyn&quot; (1886), &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot; (1884), &quot;Khanlar Bahadur&quot; (1886), and &quot;Shirin&quot; (1887). His plays mainly revolve around the heroic deeds of people in the history of Azerbaijan, but his historical plays do not have a profound philosophical content. As well as plays, he also wrote novels and short stories such as &quot;Koroghlu&quot; (1872), &quot;Xirayi&quot; (1872), &quot;Jabal&quot; (1872), &quot;Dashtadem&quot; (1873), &quot;Shah Abbas and Kamaleddin Efendi&quot; (1879), &quot;Bahadur Khan Shaku&quot; (1880), &quot;Shah Mansur&quot; (1882), &quot;Shirin&quot; (1886), &quot;Sulthan Mahmud&quot; (1888), &quot;Dervish Khudadat&quot; (1886), &quot;Agha Mammad Hasan&quot; (1888), &quot;Qataghani&quot; (1889), &quot;Khurshidbanu Natavan&quot; (1889), &quot;Nebiy&quot; (1890), &quot;Unsulli&quot; (1890), and &quot;Gulbakhor&quot; (1890).\n\nHis two most famous works are &quot;Seyid Huseyn&quot; (1886) and &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot; (1884). &quot;Seyid Huseyn&quot; was written after the Karabakh liberation movement (1830-1835) and was first staged in 1873. It is a work of realism and it depicts the life of the Azerbaijani feudal landlord Seyid Huseyn. It was written in the tradition of oriental tales and was praised for its artistic value and the depiction of people. &quot;Arshin Mal Alan&quot; is a work of realist-idealistic nature. It tells about the greed of people and how this brings misfortune to them. This work was praised for the beauty of its language and for the pathos of its characters.\n\nIn addition to his plays and novels, Rafibeyli translated several plays by Russian playwrights into Azerbaijani.\n\nRaf]" time="1.855"><properties><property name="score" value="0.8500946760177612" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_roberta_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\nIn looking at the definition of the word constitution, it becomes clear that the purpose of the Constitution was to establish a form of government for the United States of America.

Rang anzusiedeln. Hier sind dementsprechend einige russische Technologien in den vergangenen Jahren installiert worden. Vor allem Stromerzeugung von Solarzellen hat sich f\xfcr Kuba als erfolgreich erwiesen. In den vergangenen f\xfcnf Jahren wurden 2.000 Solarzellen in Kuba eingesetzt.\n\nDer Nutzen von Solarzellen f\xfcr Kuba\n\nSolarenergie f\xf6rdert auf Kuba gesundheitlich viele Vorteile. Erstens erzeugt sie Strom, was f\xfcr einen Staat, der wie Kuba so viele wichtige Schritte in Sachen Energie f\xfcr eine modernisierte Gesellschaft geht, eine gro\xdfe Rolle spielt. Die Energiegewinnung wird damit auch in Kuba demographisch ausgeglichen.\n\nZweitens l\xf6st die Sonnenenergie den direkten Nutzen f\xfcr die medizinische Versorgung aus. Das bedeutet, dass Solarzellen auch f\xfcr die Versorgung von medizinischem Ger\xe4t eingesetzt werden k\xf6nnen, wodurch wiederum die Gesundheit der Menschen verbessert wird. So gesehen ist die Installation von Solarzellen eine entscheidende Sache, die f\xfcr eine langfristige Gesundheit von Menschen gesorgt hat.\n\nWie werden Solarzellen produziert?\n\nAuch wenn das Wetter auf Kuba eine gro\xdfe Rolle spielt, kann man aufgrund der Klima\xe4nderungen auf der Insel mit einem bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Anwendung von Solarenergie rechnen. Daher werden die Solarzellen auf Kuba in gro\xdfem Umfang eingesetzt. Wie genau das im Einzelnen geschieht, zeigt das Beispiel des Leuchtturms \u201eLa Revoluci\xf3n\u201c in der Provinz Las Tunas. Dieser wurde mit Solarzellen gebaut, weil die vorhandene Infrastruktur einige Herausforderungen mit sich bringt. Die Installation der Solarzellen hat dementsprechend unmittelbare Erfolge mit sich gebracht.\n\nDer Leuchtturm befindet sich auf einer Klippe, die einen Abstand von 1.250 Metern zum Festland hat. Es gibt keine M\xf6glichkeit, in den Turm ein Stromkabel einzuziehen. Das ist deshalb ein Problem, weil dieser Turm eine gewisse Gr\xf6\xdfe hat. Die M\xf6glichkeit, dass der Strom aus der Natur umweltfreundlich gewonnen werden kann, wird durch die Installation der Solarzellen genutzt. Wie es ebenfalls erw\xe4hnt wurde, befindet sich der Leuchtturm auf einer Klippe und somit auch einige Kilometer von der Siedlung entfernt. Deshalb ist es hier sehr lohnenswert, Solarzellen zu installieren.\n\nDie gro\xdfe Stromproduktion des Leuchtturms ist das Resultat des Einsatzes von Solarenergie. Der gesamte Energiebedarf wird damit gedeckt. Solarzellen haben sich dementsprechend als eine \xe4u\xdferst wertvolle Sache f\xfcr Kuba erwiesen. Dadurch wird eine stromproduzierende Stelle sichergestellt, die unabh\xe4ngig vom Regenwetter ist. Somit haben Solarzellen einen unglaublich hohen Nutzen f\xfcr Kuba.\n\nFazit\n\nDie Installation von Solarzellen auf Kuba stellt somit einen sehr wichtigen Baustein f\xfcr das Funktionieren der Gesellschaft dar. Die Produktion von Strom aus Sonnenenergie f\xf6rdert die Gesundheit, da sie dem Bev\xf6lkerungswachstum Rechnung tr\xe4gt. Solarzellen sind daher auch in Kuba eine wichtige Sache, um die Energieversorgung zu sichern.]" time="2.830"><properties><property name="score" value="0.9998112320899963" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.99981123&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.99981123

Sometimes, however, there are complications that are difficult to solve. For example, the images provided by a coronary angiography may not be clear enough for the doctor to determine the problem. In this situation, it is necessary to perform an intervention for coronary angioplasty. This is a technique that was introduced in the 1970s and has been improved many times over the years.\n\nWhat is coronary angioplasty?\n\nCoronary angioplasty is a technique that allows the narrowing of a coronary artery to be dilated. This is done with the use of a catheter that has a flexible balloon at its end. This is inflated and deflated so that the artery is dilated. Once the dilation is achieved, a stent is implanted to keep the artery dilated and allow blood to flow properly. The stent is a small metal ring that is placed inside the lumen of the artery. It acts as a scaffold and prevents the vessel from closing. This is important because, if this happened, the part of the heart that receives blood from this artery would not receive any more.\n\nCoronary angioplasty is performed under general anesthesia. The patient is given nitroglycerin so that the pain caused by the dilation of the artery is less intense. Sometimes, if the patient has chest pain, an injection of painkillers may be needed.\n\nAfter the procedure is completed, the patient is observed to make sure he has not had any complications. If the patient develops a hematoma, the artery is usually clamped again and the hematoma is removed by inserting a small wire.\n\nThe risk of complications is low. They can develop in patients who have had angioplasty many times or who have had previous heart attacks.\n\nThe main advantage of angioplasty is that it provides immediate relief for the patient. If the stent works well, the patient may need to take medication for the rest of his life. This is an important advantage for those who have suffered a heart attack and are at risk of a second one.\n\nIn certain cases, it is necessary to repeat the intervention several times until the lumen of the artery becomes stable. Usually, the procedure is done after 4-6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s progress.]" time="1.196"><properties><property name="score" value="0.3618270953496297"
