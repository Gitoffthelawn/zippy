# Internet noise-cancelling headphones

This is a proof-of-concept extension that uses the LZMA-based ZipPy (ported to Nim/JS) to set the transparency of each paragraph to the 
confidence that ZipPy has that the text is LLM-generated.

By enabling Developer Mode in the Extensions page of your Chromium-based browser, you can then Load unpacked
extensions, point it at the root of this repo and you should be able to install it.
