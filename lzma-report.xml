As the school has continued to grow, so has the number of teachers.\n\nBy the year 2009, Glacier Ridge had expanded to offer a preschool through 12th grade education, and the school had grown to almost 200 students. In the fall of 2013, the enrollment was over 300 students.\n\nThe school started with the first graduating class of 2002. They are now on their 11th graduating class, and the school's graduates continue to receive acceptance to universities across the United States. The school offers several Advanced Placement classes.\n\nGlacier Ridge has had its students participate in various competitions and competitions. Most notable are the sports teams, especially their basketball teams, which have qualified for state competition multiple times. The school has also had various music groups participate in state and regional competitions, and in the 2010-2011 school year, the school sent students to participate in an International Children's Games competition in Romania.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 school year, a group of the school's teachers were sent to Haiti to help establish a new orphanage, &quot;Eli's Children's House&quot;, which was dedicated to Eli Pierre, who had died in a motorcycle accident. They were instrumental in bringing the orphanage into the community by helping establish new programs for the children, including English as a Second Language, Computer Lab, and Physical Education classes. The teachers assisted in the education of the orphans as well as working with the staff on the property.\n\nThe school has also taken various trips over the years, including trips to Virginia and New York City. The school also hosted an educational trip to Washington D.C. for one of their graduating classes.\n\nThe school has participated in various community events and service projects. One of the most notable is their annual &quot;Twilight Prom&quot; that is held each spring. Each year, the school hosts a prom for local high school students who have special needs. The students' dates are typically their own siblings.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, a fire destroyed the school's auditorium, causing over $1 million in damages. After the school received an outpouring of support, the school was able to begin construction on a new auditorium in time for the next school year.\n\nIn 2015, Glacier Ridge Christian School became part of the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\nThe School is affiliated with the Association of Christian Schools International, the Ohio Christian Education Association, and the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\n]" time="0.058"><properties><property name="score" value="0.05387341804247159" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_lzma_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season\n\nThe 2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season, part of college football in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division I Football Championship Subdivision level, began on September 6, 2003, and concluded with the National Championship Game of the NCAA Division I Football Championship on December 21, 2003, at Finley Stadium in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord.&quot;\n\nEzekiel 33:11-11\n\nGod wants every sinner to be saved. He does not want people to perish but be saved. God hates sin, and sin destroys a person. But He loves people. He created them to have fellowship with Him and one day live in His Kingdom, and He does not want that for one person to be lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod's command to Ezekiel was that He was telling him to go and tell the people of Israel that they need to turn to God, because they were going to die if they did not. We know that Ezekiel told them the same thing, because God's word is truth. God's Word does not fail.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat God is saying is that people are going to die if they do not turn to Him. People who reject God will die. The Bible says in Romans 1:32, &quot;Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.&quot; God says that those people who do these things deserve death, and yet people continue to do them and approve of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod will not tolerate the sinful acts of humanity, but He wants every person to be saved. There is only one way to be saved. The Bible says in John 14:6, &quot;Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one can be saved except through Jesus Christ, but when people put Jesus as their savior, they are saved. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many people who call themselves Christians who say that God wants everyone to be saved, and they quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, but they don't realize that God's word is truth. God says in Revelation 21:8, &quot;But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars\u2014their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one way to be saved, and it is not through anyone or anything but Jesus Christ. Jesus is the only way to heaven. God says that all the people who are going to perish are going to go to a place called the second death. That's hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, they don't realize that God's word is truth. They don't realize that when they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are not telling the truth. When they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are putting God in a box, because God's word is truth. God says that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior are going to perish. God's word is truth, and people who do not put their faith in Jesus Christ are going to die.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bible says in John 14:6, &quot;Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus is the only way to the Father, and no one can be saved except through Him. He died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead on the third day, and He sits at the right hand of God, interceding for us. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at Ezekiel 33:11-11, and read it carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says that He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. God does not like it when people die. But God hates sin, and sin leads to death. If people want to live, they must turn from their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf people don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. God doesn't want that. He doesn't want people to perish, but to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod wants people to put their faith in Jesus Christ. If people put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are saved. If they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. That's the truth. That's the message of Ezekiel 33:11-11.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople are going to die if they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ. People will perish. People will be lost. People will be doomed. People will go to hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's read Ezekiel 33:11-12.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone,&quot; declares the Sovereign Lord. &quot;Repent and live!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nGod takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. God does not want anyone to perish. He doesn't want anyone to die. He wants people to repent and live. God is saying that He is not going to stand back and watch as people perish. He's going to do something about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says in Ezekiel 33:13-16, &quot;Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel? I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Do you think I take pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?

Let's say I have the following array of numbers:\n\nvar myNumbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\nThe following snippet of code would display the same numbers in reverse order:\n\nfor ( var i = myNumbers.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i-- ) { console.log( myNumbers[i] ); }\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nWe know that the index of an array can be used as a &quot;pointer&quot; to the location in memory that contains a particular item in an array. If the array myNumbers has five items, then myNumbers[0] , myNumbers[1] , myNumbers[2] , myNumbers[3] and myNumbers[4] will point to the values 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nIn the previous example, the code starts with the length of the array (5) and subtracts one from it. As we know that index 0 in an array contains the first item in the array, the previous code will execute the following steps:\n\nTake the length of the array (5) Subtract 1 (so we now have 4) Start at the index that contains the first item in the array (myNumbers[4] = 3) and run down the array until we reach the last item in the array (myNumbers[3] = 5)\n\nSo the above code will end up displaying the items in the array in reverse order, starting at index 4 and working backwards to index 0.\n\nAt this point, we have a good idea of how we can access the values in an array in a specific order, but how do we go the other way?\n\nIt would be great if we could simply use the same code as above, but add a &quot;--&quot; operator before the last number. That way, we could add a simple parameter to the code to control the range of numbers it will use.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't do that. While JavaScript will happily work with -- , it will also happily take -- in code and convert it to -1 , or the last number in an array. That's not going to do us any good, as we want the code to be flexible enough that we can work with a number that we specify as the range of numbers.\n\nSo let's look at a simple function that can give us the results we need.\n\nfunction rotate(numbers, direction, number) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push(number); numbers.unshift(number); };\n\nThe rotate function above has three parameters, and will rotate the values in the numbers array.\n\nnumbers is the array we want to use.\n\ndirection is the parameter that allows us to choose whether we want the values to be rotated in the direction we specify. In this case, we've chosen direction to be either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;\n\nnumber is the number we're using as the upper bound of the range that we want to use.\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\n\nAs we can see, the numbers array is simply rotated right by the number we specified. That's fine, but let's add in some code that we can use to control which numbers are displayed:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 1 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 4, 3, 5, 2 ]\n\nWe can see that we've rotated the numbers so that the first number in the array is now number 1 , and the next number in the array is 4 .\n\nWe've also specified that we want to rotate in a right-handed manner, by passing &quot;right&quot; as the second parameter. This means that we have access to the following rotation values:\n\nrotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;right&quot; ); rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; );\n\nIf we try to access the rotate function with &quot;left&quot; as the parameter, we'll see the following output:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, &quot;left&quot; ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nNot quite what we wanted, right?\n\nWhat we want is to be able to take an array, specify the number of numbers we want to display, and be able to choose the direction of rotation.\n\nWe also want to ensure that the values we are displaying are always within the array's bounds, and we're using them correctly.\n\nThe good news is that it's not too difficult to do this. We simply need to know what we want the code to look like, and write the code to do what we want it to do.\n\nLet's take a look at some simple code to display the numbers in an array in a given direction:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nrotateArray function\n\nThis is the code we'll use to display the numbers in the numbers array in the direction we specify. We'll start with a simple parameter:\n\nstartAt is the number we're displaying. It can either be the first number in the array, or any number within the array.\n\nLet's take a look at the code again:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing this simple function, we can take any number of numbers, and display them in the direction we want. Let's look at a quick example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;left&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nThis time, we've used &quot;left&quot; as the direction, and we've also used the parameter &quot;3&quot; as the startAt value. The result is that we now have the numbers displayed in the array starting at the number 3 .\n\nIf we use a number that isn't within the bounds of the array, we'll get the following result:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nAs you can see, the direction we've specified is &quot;right&quot;, and the value we've specified for startAt is 3 . Unfortunately, this value isn't within the bounds of the array, so the values in the array have been displayed starting from the last number in the array.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can use this code to work with a number that's outside the bounds of the array:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, &quot;right&quot;, 6 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nThis time, we've specified &quot;right&quot; as the direction, and a value of 6 as the startAt parameter. The result is that we now have the values displayed in the array starting at the number 6 .\n\nThis time, the result we want is displayed in the array, but there's a problem. We don't want the number 6 to be the start of the array. Instead, we want it to be the last number in the array.\n\nThe good news is that we can easily handle this by modifying the code slightly:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing the simple rotation code above, we can now take any array, specify the number we want to display, and choose the direction we want to use. This means we can write some simple code that can work with any number, regardless of its position in the array.\n\nThe next step is to write some code that can ensure the number we specify as the startAt is in the range that we expect.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can do that:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { if( startAt &gt;= numbers.length ) { throw new RangeError(&quot;Start at is outside of the]" time="0.076"><properties><property name="score" value="0.18576626194144463" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_lzma_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[Contents\n\n1. The Meaning of Love\n\n2. Our Attitude Toward Others\n\n3. The Two Great Commandments\n\n4. Developing Love\n\n5. How to Help Others\n\n6. The Golden Rule\n\n7. The Commandments in the New Testament\n\n8. Tolerance\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Meaning of Love\n\nBefore we can love others, we must know the meaning of love. It is important to love God and obey Him and to have a right relationship with Him. But to have a right relationship with Him we must love Him. That means that we must have a good relationship with all His laws.\n\nOf course we can't keep all the commandments all the time. Yet we must have a good relationship with them. Otherwise we will not know what God is like.\n\nLove is based on God's law.\n\nRomans 13:10. The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nGalatians 5:14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nLove is based on God's law. We should study God's commandments and know the laws He has given us. Then we will know how to have a good relationship with Him.\n\nOne reason we are to love God and obey Him is that it is important to have a good relationship with God. We need to know how much God loves us. Without knowing this we cannot have a right relationship with God. We need to have a good relationship with Him so we can be happy and serve Him better.\n\nLet us understand what love is.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nIn these verses John explained that love is the opposite of lawlessness. Love is the opposite of murder, hatred, malice, evil, adultery, stealing, lying, and a lot of other bad things.\n\nRomans 13:8-10. Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law. For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\n\nWe learn from this that the opposite of love is lawlessness. The opposite of love is murder, hatred, envy, malice, evil, and all the other things mentioned in these verses.\n\nVerse 10 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; In other words, love is a good thing. It is a good thing to have a good relationship with God.\n\nRomans 13:8 says, &quot;Love does no harm to a neighbor.&quot; Love helps and blesses others.\n\nLove is a good thing. The reason love is a good thing is because God is love.\n\n1 John 4:16. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love; and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.\n\nVerse 8 says, &quot;God is love.&quot; God's name is Love.\n\nGod's name is Love.\n\nJohn 4:8. \u2026 the well was deep; and I said, &quot;How shall I get down?&quot;\n\nAnd he said, &quot;Come, and I will show you.&quot;\n\n9. And he said, &quot;Draw you [a] little water out of the well, and \u2026 drink.&quot;\n\n10. And I said, &quot;Sir, give me [a] little to drink.&quot;\n\n11. And he said, &quot;Drink, my [b] son, and \u2026 your eyes shall be opened.&quot;\n\n12. And I drank, and it was as if I had had new vision given to me; for I could see [c] through those walls of water.\n\n13. And he said to me, &quot;Go [a] down, for the water is [b] yet a little way below the earth. \u2026\n\n15. \u2026 This water is [c] that which I said \u2026 will make you come up hither.&quot;\n\n16. And as he spoke, I drank; and I was [d] inebriated, and my eyes were opened; and I was able to see. \u2026\n\n19. \u2026 &quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;follow me \u2026 and I will give you \u2026 rest.&quot;\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:9. \u2026 God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nGod is our salvation. God is our rest. God is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\n1 Peter 2:6. \u2026 you may be \u2026 a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.\n\nGod is our first fruits.\n\n2 Timothy 2:13. If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he cannot deny himself.\n\nGod is faithful.\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nHebrews 4:10-13. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his own works, as God did from His. Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest \u2026\n\n12. \u2026 For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\n13. \u2026 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 3:16,18. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\n\n19. But whoso has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nThe Bible says that God is love.\n\nWe can study love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

The opposite of love is law.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving Him.\n\nThe Bible says that God is love.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving Him.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving God.\n\nJohn 14:21.

Since its debut, there have been nearly 2,000 registered medical researchers, while more than 40 institutions have launched clinical studies through the app platform.\n\n\n\nBut there are several hurdles for Apple and its partners. On Wednesday, Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, will join at a panel discussion at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to examine what works and what\u2019s missing in the fast-evolving field of mobile health.\n\n\n\nThe session, titled \u201cWhat Are the Future Directions for ResearchKit?\u201d comes after a first wave of successful projects on ResearchKit, including apps that help people manage diabetes, heart disease and asthma.\n\n\n\nThere are also some examples of the problems Apple is facing as it tries to get more partners to adopt the tool. Earlier this month, a major player in the diabetes community said it would not be taking part in the app\u2019s data collection. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said in a statement that its members were not interested in the iPhone platform and \u201cwould prefer to conduct research studies using our own patient data that is gathered on an Android platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s likely an expensive prospect for the organization, given the popularity of iPhones in the United States. As of last year, Android devices accounted for just over half of all U.S. smartphone subscribers, while iOS devices made up around 41 percent. That\u2019s according to the Pew Research Center, which estimated last year that there were 121 million iPhone users in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe success of Apple\u2019s platform will hinge in part on how it handles data privacy and security concerns. Apple had to clear some hurdles in the early days of ResearchKit because many people were concerned about privacy when they heard it would rely on data from Apple\u2019s servers. Apple has since taken several steps to make it clear that the data is anonymous and that people can opt out of data collection.\n\n\n\nThe app program could also be a major part of the iPhone\u2019s future if it takes off. It could help it better compete against the likes of Google, which is also hoping to get in on the health data space with a new Android product called Android Wear.\n\n\n\nThe first public version of ResearchKit will be unveiled on Wednesday, the panel will also include representatives from Mount Sinai and Pfizer.\n\n\n\nThat event will be at 11:30 a.m. EDT in New York City, and it will be livestreamed on Fortune\u2019s website.]" time="0.071"><properties><property name="score" value="0.08212340796613186" /></properties></testcase><testcase classname="test_lzma_detect" name="test_gpt3_jsonl[\n\nSend this thread via email by filling out the fields below\n\n\n\nThread: Lost 10lbs in the last 3 weeks Send To:\n\nUse semi-colon to separate multiple addresses Your Name: Your Email: Add a personal message: Send this thread via email by filling out the fields below\n\n\n\n]" time="0.026"><properties><property name="score" value="0.08522751945544416" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.08522752&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.08522752

But I do find it quite uncomfortable seeing them.&quot;\n\nThe Royal family came together to celebrate the wedding of Kate's sister to hedge fund manager James Matthews in the Berkshire village of Englefield.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd while Pippa and James' wedding was a private affair with just 200 guests, they were still surrounded by some royals as well as other notable names.\n\nLady Amelia's father is the Queen's first cousin, so it was no surprise to see the Queen herself attend the wedding, alongside Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan.\n\nThe Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also there, as well as Kate's sister, Pippa's brother James Middleton, David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John.\n\nLady Amelia revealed that she even had a few words with Harry and Meghan, with the former asking her how she felt about her cousin's big day.\n\nShe said: &quot;I had a little conversation with Harry and Meghan, and they said how lovely the wedding was. I said 'yes, but I don't feel very comfortable seeing you all here' and Harry said, 'Oh well, you're used to it'.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n&quot;I said, 'Yes, but it is still very strange to see you here'. I suppose you can't blame me, I am a bit naive. But the whole thing was really lovely.&quot;\n\nShe added: &quot;I mean, James is my cousin, I grew up with him and I love him dearly, so it was really lovely to see him. It was a lovely wedding, they are such a lovely couple. I am so pleased they are so happy.&quot;\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nAnd as for what she thought of her father's outfit - which caused much comment among fans - she admitted she wasn't sure.\n\nShe said: &quot;Well, he always wears an odd choice of clothes, but that is what he likes.

You may have a thousand bucks of cordless tools, but there\u2019s nothing that will do as much as this one will do. As you might have noticed, the construction of this unit is incredibly sturdy, so that you don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking when you use it. Also, it is a bit heavy, and it will take a while to get used to using it, especially if you have not used any other heavy drills.\n\nPower\n\nWe also tested the power of this Dewalt DW3200 and we must say that it is very impressive. It delivers 3,300 RPM, which is more than enough to bore holes and drill in all kinds of materials. It can easily penetrate into wood, brick, or concrete and it can bore holes up to two inches. The trigger lock mechanism also works well, which makes this drill safer to use.\n\nCordless or corded?\n\nIt is important to remember that this drill can work either as a corded or a cordless unit, and this is very important for you to know. This Dewalt DW3200 uses the 20 volt lithium-ion batteries and they can last longer than you might expect. They are also very light and durable, so you will be able to use them for a long time. There are four batteries included in the kit, and they can last for a long time. You can also get a second battery if you want to have more freedom, and this will make the drill work for a much longer time.\n\nExtra Features\n\nYou may also like the extra features included in this Dewalt DW3200. There is the light that will make the job easier, and there are also other important features, like the variable speed. This is also a very durable drill, so it will last for a very long time. Also, the build quality is fantastic, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking easily.\n\nOverall\n\nIf you have a lot of different drilling needs, this is the drill for you. This drill is perfect for the casual user, but it can also be used by professionals. It is also very durable, so you can use it for a very long time, and you will get the most for your money. You should also remember that this drill is very powerful, and it can work for a long time, without breaking down.\n\nIf you want to see what more we have, you can visit Amazon.com and check all of the available drills.

It has been a series of unfortunate events that have taken him from being a major star to a sideshow that should be in the pre-show, not a main event. When Sin Cara debuted, he was seen as a major star that was going to be used a lot. It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe problem was that he never delivered.\n\nHe was so unimpressive that he was booted from WWE in 2016. He is making an appearance at WrestleMania 33. For his sake, it would be best if he kept quiet and didn't interact with the crowd.\n\n9 Kelly Kelly\n\nvia tumblr.com\n\nKelly Kelly was a fan favorite during her time in WWE. She made her debut as a popular model who was wrestling on ECW. From there, she rose to the top as a valuable part of the roster. Kelly became a popular figure who had her own dedicated fans. She had the right amount of talent to be a decent worker, but it was her good looks that gave her the extra push.\n\nAfter leaving WWE in 2012, Kelly kept wrestling. She is back on the roster with TNA, but she has not appeared on a television episode of Impact Wrestling since December of 2015.\n\n8 Alberto Del Rio\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is a sad truth that Alberto Del Rio has fallen from his former position in the industry. He was a very big part of WWE. He was not only the United States Champion, but also a World Champion. Alberto had a unique presence as a superstar that could do things no one else could do. He also had the microphone skills to back up his moves.\n\nHis tenure in WWE was marred with incidents that made it clear he was not going to be there much longer. His time in Lucha Underground was more memorable, but it was a step down from what he used to be.\n\n7 The Great Khali\n\nvia cagesideseats.com\n\nThe Great Khali is not really a superstar that anyone really misses. His presence was laughable at times. The thing about Khali is that he had a lot of potential. He was very big and very strong, but he never seemed to have any clue about how to use those traits to his advantage.\n\nKhali is now an actor and a former wrestler. He is part of the reality show Khali Kisses, which involves him doing a lot of kisses on people. It is a far cry from his WWE days.\n\n6 Kelly Kelly's Boyfriend\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nWrestlers who are lucky enough to find a wife have a much easier time in the wrestling industry. The same could not be said for Mike Knox. He was only a superstar for a very short time, and he was a part of one of the most bizarre moments in wrestling history when he got the Attitude Adjustment from Kane. Knox is not talked about much these days, but there was a time when people were curious about him.\n\nHe married the popular WWE superstar Kelly Kelly. The couple got married in 2014. It was a marriage that was not meant to last, as the couple divorced in 2016.\n\n5 Santino Marella\n\nvia ringsidenews.com\n\nSantino Marella will forever be a part of WWE. The WWE Hall of Fame is home to some great wrestlers and some very bad wrestlers. Santino is among those who have made an impression for one reason or another. His career with the company was not as successful as he had hoped, but he made a huge impact. He was the guy who was hilarious because he was so bad.\n\nSantino's last match was in 2014. He has done some backstage work, but the star has pretty much disappeared from WWE.\n\n4 Tyson Kidd\n\nvia heavy.com\n\nTyson Kidd was a true performer in WWE. He had a unique look, and he could really do it all. The man was skilled on the mic, in the ring, and he had a good personality. Everything came together for Tyson, but that would all change during an unfortunate injury. Tyson was a mid-carder who could have risen to a top level, but that was not meant to be.\n\nKidd is now recovering from his neck injury. He is still hoping to get into the ring again, but it is looking unlikely.\n\n3 Christian\n\nvia bodybuilding.com\n\nChristian is not a name that is being mentioned much these days. It is a shame, as he is one of the best performers of his time. Christian has made a career of being known for his impressive in-ring work and his ability to entertain fans. Christian was a popular superstar during his time in WWE and he did some good things for TNA.\n\nChristian has not been in the ring since December of 2015. He is trying to get back into the ring, but there is a possibility that his neck injury may have ended his career.\n\n2 Dolph Ziggler\n\nvia wrestlingnewssource.com\n\nDolph Ziggler had the chance to become a very big star in WWE. Unfortunately, things have not been going well for Ziggler. He was once a main eventer, but he has fallen to the bottom of the card. He is one of the many guys who will be pushed as the underdog who is going to have the moment of their life.\n\nZiggler has not been the focus of WWE. It is likely that he will be entering a new chapter of his career in the near future. The most likely place would be in Ring of Honor, but WWE has shown a lot of interest in Ziggler.\n\n1 Wade Barrett\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the casual fan to remember Wade Barrett. He had a short run in WWE, but he did his part as a mid-carder. Barrett is a former Intercontinental Champion. He did well in WWE as a member of The Nexus, but his star power never quite took off.\n\nBarrett has been out of WWE since 2014. He has had some ups and downs in the independent circuit, but his career has largely gone downhill. It is possible that he could get another chance with WWE. That would probably be the only way that fans would get to see him again.\n\nBarrett has been trying to make a name for himself in the business world. He launched a website last year. It is not likely that he will become a success, but it is nice to see him try to make something of his life.]" time="0.097"><properties><property name="score" value="0.5388144646339252" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.53881446&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.53881446

The partnership will see the creation of two exclusive, made-for-VR games from Bethesda Game Studios; the first is currently being designed for virtual reality and the second is being built for traditional monitors.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt Oculus, we\u2019re dedicated to helping developers and partners to grow, and the support and dedication we\u2019ve received from Bethesda Game Studios has been outstanding,\u201d said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus. \u201cJohn Carmack, founder of id Software and now CTO at Oculus, believes in our vision and has created a custom version of Doom 3 BFG Edition for Oculus. We look forward to continuing to work with Bethesda as we develop our first generation of virtual reality games and experiences.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a lot of personal interest in making sure that the VR gaming space is successful because I really believe in the technology and its potential to change gaming,\u201d said Carmack. \u201cAs a developer, the Rift is something that I\u2019ve wanted to work with for a long time, but the existing technology wasn\u2019t quite there yet. I\u2019m happy to be able to help to make the Rift a success and contribute to the rebirth of VR gaming.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt Bethesda Game Studios, developers are working on a number of unannounced projects including new entries in major franchises. Those who have seen this year\u2019s E3 show floor, Gamescom or Quakecon presentations have seen teases of what the studio is up to and a few of the titles we have in development are also being designed for virtual reality. The two games announced today are entirely new IP and we can\u2019t wait to show them to you when they\u2019re ready for primetime.\n\n\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Bethesda Game Studios, the acclaimed developer is responsible for creating many of the industry\u2019s most popular games including the \u201cElder Scrolls\u201d series, the single-player add-on to the original \u201cDoom\u201d and the \u201cFallout\u201d series.

So, how have you all been doing?\n\nToday, I have a special post. I know most of you do not know but it is the 'World Animal Day'. The day is celebrated worldwide on October 4 to create awareness of animal rights and welfare. The day is a very special one for me because I am a vegetarian, animal lover and a dog-person.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the last one year, I have been trying to spread the awareness among the people. I have been trying to encourage people to stop using animals as fur coats, cosmetics and for food. I want people to know the feelings of these animals, the pains they suffer and what they go through while they are alive. Also, the environmental damage they cause to the planet. It is very important to spread this message because animals are treated as if they are some sort of toys that we can play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, I would like to share with you some tips on how we can help the animals and make the planet a better place to live. I also have a small personal pledge to make. Also, if you have not signed the pledge yet, you can also make your own pledge to protect the animals and the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips and pledges to help the animals\n\n(made by my friend!)\n\nOne way we can make a change is by making an effort to not use cosmetics that are tested on animals. We can choose to use all cruelty free products and make a conscious effort not to use anything that has been tested on animals.\n\nWays to reduce our carbon footprints and help protect the environment:\n\nAvoid eating meat, or even better, go vegetarian (dairy, eggs are not vegan but I still encourage you to stop using dairy products as well)\n\nUse eco-friendly products - Not just cosmetics but also in our everyday lives.\n\nGo cruelty free - Choose cruelty free products and wear clothes that have not been made out of leather, fur or wool.\n\nStop buying those animals that we do not need. Also, choose to buy second hand or recycled clothes. Avoid buying pets if you cannot provide the proper care for them.\n\nAdopt, don't buy! You can adopt a dog or cat from an animal shelter. Do not buy animals from pet stores or breeders. They are sold to you as &quot;breed-free&quot; animals but most of them have been bred in horrible conditions. Also, make sure you know the sex of the animal you are getting, because they usually are sold as 'un-neutered' or 'un-spayed' animals.\n\nMake a conscious effort to not use plastic bags. Use reusable bags or better still, try to avoid using bags at all.\n\nTry to use products that do not harm the environment and are biodegradable.\n\nWays to help the animals:\n\nSign the pledge - To show that you support the cause to protect the animals.\n\nShare the post - Let others know of the cruelty that the animals go through. Let them know how they can help the animals too.\n\nJoin or start a protest or campaign to help the animals.\n\nThe small pledge I am making is to help the animals. Every month, I will be donating some money to an animal shelter in my town to help feed the dogs and cats there.\n\nThese are just some of the ways we can help the animals and the planet. We can all make a change, and make this planet a better place to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know how to become a vegan, and which cosmetics are tested on animals, you can read this post: How to be a vegan?\n\nRemember, we are what we eat, so be what you want to be. Be a good person, who loves animals and helps to save the planet.\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nPriya]" time="0.098"><properties><property name="score" value="0.00786284861861719" /></properties><failure message="AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00786285&#10;assert 'Human' == 'AI'&#10;  - AI&#10;  + Human">E   AssertionError: samples/GPT-3-175b_samples.jsonl is an LLM-generated sample, misclassified as human-generated with confidence 0.00786285

Roots can become entangled in the small cracks between the asphalt and the cement to create the impression that the tree is growing out of the road! And when the roots do become entwined, the pressure can be so great that the roots are destroyed. We all know the danger this creates for the trees.\n\nThe solution to this problem is obvious: pave over the whole road surface. Not so fast! In the City of Chicago, for example, there is a practice that preserves the utility of the tree\u2019s roots and of the road surface itself. The practice is called \u201cmilling\u201d. Milling involves cutting the asphalt out in a shape that will not disturb the roots and adding back in a new surface. While the tree is protected, the roots are not disturbed and the road surface is left intact. When a tree is scheduled for removal, this is often the method of choice. Milling also involves improving the root zone around the tree. The roots of many trees can\u2019t penetrate the compacted soil that is found beneath pavement, so it is necessary to mill the area to promote root growth.\n\nMilling is less expensive than paving over a road surface and can also be less expensive than removal of a tree.

For some, the reason is because they still have some of their shopping list to complete. Others, however, have an entirely different reason.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian adult will spend $473.12 on gifts this holiday season. That means the average consumer will spend almost $35 more this year than last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of consumers have gone overboard,\u201d says Ted Michalos, founder of CMG Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the spending that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s what they\u2019re spending the money on.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because many shoppers are buying gifts for themselves. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re spending on the latest fashions, but rather toys and electronics. And the majority of these gifts, at 41.8 per cent, are going to be purchased online.\n\nHowever, the reason why so many people are spending online is because they\u2019re trying to avoid the crowds and waiting in lines.\n\n\u201cSome consumers just get too stressed and they go online to get their stuff,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd if they do that, they\u2019re likely going to be paying more for the gifts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because while there are fewer people at the store, they\u2019re paying more per person. For example, if someone is paying $50 for a gift in the store, they\u2019re likely to pay more than $50 online.\n\n\u201cThis is really the time where you\u2019re going to have to do your best to have everything done by the 15th,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cAnd it\u2019s definitely a good idea to sit down with your spouse or significant other and look at your budget. And when you have a child, the best thing to do is to write down what you\u2019re going to spend. That\u2019s a real good thing to do, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll overspend.\u201d\n\nAnd that could come with consequences, because if you\u2019re overspending, you could be limiting your ability to spend on your children or other family members in the future.\n\n\u201cYou can go overboard and give away everything you have to your kids and that could be a problem,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cThis could be an opportunity to teach your kids about moderation, and also the difference between \u2018I want\u2019 and \u2018I need.\u2019\u201d\n\nBecause with Christmas, most people are shopping with the mindset of \u2018I want,\u2019 not \u2018I need.\u2019 And that can be a problem, because it will prevent you from saving or investing.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be shopping on a credit card, you\u2019re going to be in big trouble,\u201d says Michalos. \u201cIf you\u2019re not able to pay off that debt by the end of January, you\u2019re going to be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nWant to know more about debt?

Before we start , it is better to know what is virtual machine. A virtual machine is a simulated hardware that allows you to run other operating systems (or other versions of the same OS) at the same time as your current OS, inside a window on your current OS. It can also be thought of as a computer inside a computer. With a virtual machine, you can: Run another operating system (or another version of the same operating system) at the same time as your current operating system. Try out a new operating system without having to install it on your hard disk. Run applications for one operating system on another, without having to reboot your computer.\n\nStep 1: Create a New Virtual Machine\n\nVirtualBox provides a wizard that will assist you in creating a virtual machine. Launch the program and select \u201cNew\u201d.\n\nStep 2: Create a Virtual Machine\n\nThe first window you see is the New Virtual Machine Wizard. Select \u201cCreate a virtual machine\u201d.\n\nStep 3: Create a Virtual Machine\n\nIn the next window, enter the name for your virtual machine.

She then deleted the picture from her camera roll when it was over, and the man asked if she had. She said yes, and then he said this:\n\n&quot;It's a shame we can't see the photo anymore because it was pretty good&quot;\n\nShe didn't know how to respond. He then tweeted her back, asking her to &quot;leave [the photo] up for a little while&quot;. She declined.\n\nApparently, he then texted her back, asking her to send him a copy of the picture.\n\nShocked by this behaviour, she shared the exchange on Twitter, and said the worst part was how &quot;unbothered&quot; he seemed about it.\n\nEventually she shared a screenshot of the exchange, and people were not impressed.\n\n&quot;Oh wow. 'I'd do ya if I could' and then the photo request. You should probably just block him and be done with it. 'Doing ya' or not,&quot; one person said.\n\nAnother person had an idea on how to deal with it, tweeting, &quot;You know what? Be a bigger person, send it to him. For posterity.&quot;\n\nMany others were in complete agreement with this sentiment.\n\n&quot;I don't know this man and I probably never will. But I 100% understand why he's going to be blocked. A man who says that is definitely not a good person. All women should know their boundaries with men and this seems to me to be clear cut,&quot; one person said.\n\nIn the end, @kendtee went back to him and asked him to explain why he'd sent her that photo.\n\nAccording to @kendtee, he sent her this message in response:\n\n&quot;How do you think I know that you're gonna see this tweet and block me or delete it.\n\n&quot;I'm not trying to be a creep you just said that you'd do me so I figured we had a shot lol\n\n&quot;I like your style and want to get to know you better\n\n&quot;If you send the picture I promise not to be creepy and stop bothering you\n\n&quot;I'm being serious here and I don't think I deserve the reaction I got\n\n&quot;All I wanted to do was take a picture with a nice girl and see if she'd let me\n\n&quot;I don't want to be a bad person or make you feel uncomfortable.\n\n&quot;If you like I'll just go away\n\n&quot;You're gorgeous and I'm sorry I don't deserve to meet you but I thought I'd try my luck\n\n&quot;I won't message you again if you don't want me to\n\n&quot;I'll delete the tweet and block you\n\n&quot;I just wanted to try\n\n&quot;Please&quot;\n\nThe rest of Twitter wasn't impressed, calling him out for still not getting it, and for trying to shift the blame.\n\n&quot;Like you have to explain what 'likes your style' means, like you're trying to shift the blame.
