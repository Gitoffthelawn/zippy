READING, ENGLAND - In a shocking turn of events, a major fire has broken out at a historic building in the heart of Reading. The blaze started at around 10 PM on Monday night, and firefighters have been working tirelessly to bring it under control.

The building in question is the former home of Huntley & Palmers, a biscuit factory that was once a cornerstone of Reading's economy. The factory closed its doors in the 1970s, but the building has since been repurposed as a mixed-use development, housing offices, apartments, and a popular restaurant.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing flames and thick black smoke pouring from the roof of the building. The fire is believed to have started on the top floor of the structure and quickly spread to the lower levels. Firefighters from several nearby towns were called in to assist with the effort, and the area surrounding the building was cordoned off to keep bystanders safe.

As of 2 AM, the fire was still raging, and officials were warning nearby residents to stay indoors and keep their windows closed to avoid inhaling smoke. A spokesperson for the fire department told reporters that the blaze was one of the most challenging they had ever faced, due in part to the age and layout of the building.

'We're doing everything we can to get this fire under control, but it's a difficult situation,' the spokesperson said. 'The building is very old, with lots of nooks and crannies where the fire can spread. We're working closely with our colleagues from neighbouring towns to bring in as much equipment and manpower as possible.'

The cause of the fire is not yet known, and it's too early to say how much damage has been done to the building. However, the restaurant on the ground floor of the structure is believed to have sustained significant damage, and residents of the apartments in the building have been evacuated.

Local officials are urging people to stay away from the area while firefighters work to contain the blaze. The Reading Borough Council has also issued a statement expressing its concern for the safety of those affected by the fire.

This is a developing story, and we will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.

In the mystical realm of Eldoria, where magic permeated the air and fantastical creatures roamed freely, there existed two extraordinary goats named Astra and Lumina. These magical goats possessed incredible abilities that set them apart from their mundane counterparts.

Astra, with her shimmering ebony coat and eyes that sparkled like starlight, possessed the power to control the elements. She could conjure gusts of wind that danced around her, shaping them into powerful cyclones or gentle breezes. With a mere flick of her tail, she could summon rain to nourish parched lands or call forth lightning to electrify the skies.

Lumina, on the other hand, was a radiant goat with a magnificent coat as white as snow. She had the gift of healing, and her touch could mend wounds and ailments. The mere presence of Lumina filled the hearts of those around her with hope and tranquility. She would wander through the forests and meadows, tending to wounded creatures and bringing solace to troubled souls.

Despite their contrasting powers, Astra and Lumina were inseparable companions. They roamed the enchanted lands together, their hooves treading lightly on the moss-covered paths and their laughter echoing through the ancient trees. Wherever they went, they brought harmony and magic, spreading joy and wonder among the inhabitants of Eldoria.

One fateful day, a dark and malevolent force began to encroach upon Eldoria. An ancient sorcerer, consumed by a thirst for power, sought to harness the magic of the realm for his own twisted desires. He unleashed hordes of dark creatures to spread chaos and destruction, threatening the delicate balance that had been maintained for centuries.

Astra and Lumina sensed the impending danger and understood that it was their duty to protect their cherished realm. With unwavering determination, they set out on a perilous quest to find the legendary Crystal of Unity. Legends spoke of its ability to amplify the magic of those who wielded it, providing a glimmer of hope in the face of darkness.

Their journey took them through treacherous landscapes, where they encountered fierce guardians and overcame daunting challenges. Astra used her elemental powers to create shields and clear obstacles, while Lumina's healing abilities mended their wounds and soothed their fatigue.

Finally, after enduring countless trials, they arrived at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, where the Crystal of Unity lay hidden. It emanated a brilliant, ethereal light, drawing Astra and Lumina closer. As they touched the crystal, a surge of energy coursed through their bodies, intertwining their powers in a dazzling display of unity.

Empowered by the crystal's magic, Astra and Lumina returned to Eldoria. Their combined strength allowed them to combat the sorcerer's dark forces, unleashing powerful gusts of wind that scattered the minions and banished the sorcerer's dark enchantments.

Peace was restored to Eldoria, and the realm rejoiced in the triumph of the two magical goats. Astra and Lumina had proven that true power lies not only in individual abilities but also in the bonds of friendship and unity.

From that day forward, Astra and Lumina were hailed as heroes, their tale passed down through generations. They continued to protect Eldoria, their magic intertwined and their hearts forever united. And as long as their story lived on, hope and enchantment flourished in the land of mystical wonders.

The Power and Influence of Common Phrases

Introduction:

Language is a powerful tool that allows humans to communicate and express their thoughts, emotions, and ideas. Within the vast landscape of language, there are certain phrases that have become deeply ingrained in our daily conversations. Common phrases, also known as idioms or expressions, hold significant cultural, historical, and social value. They serve as a testament to the evolution of language and provide insights into the beliefs, experiences, and wisdom of different societies. This essay explores the origins, meanings, and impacts of common phrases, highlighting their enduring presence in our everyday lives.

Body:

Origins and Evolution:
Common phrases often have fascinating origins, tracing back to different periods of history and diverse cultures. For instance, the phrase "break a leg" commonly used to wish someone good luck, originated in the theater world, where actors believed that wishing them good luck would bring bad luck. Instead, they inverted the phrase, using its opposite to convey their well wishes. Similarly, the phrase "barking up the wrong tree" has its roots in hunting, where dogs would bark at the base of a tree, mistakenly indicating the wrong location of the prey. These phrases have evolved and endured over time, being passed down from one generation to another.

Cultural Significance:
Common phrases play a crucial role in capturing the essence of a culture. They often reflect the values, customs, and traditions of a particular society. Take, for example, the Chinese phrase "借花献佛" (jiè huā xiàn fó), which translates to "borrowing flowers to offer Buddha." This phrase illustrates the Chinese concept of guānxì, meaning building connections and leveraging existing relationships for personal gain. It encapsulates the importance of reciprocity and mutual benefits in Chinese culture. Similarly, the English phrase "the early bird catches the worm" embodies the value of punctuality and seizing opportunities, which are highly regarded in Western societies.

Communicative Efficiency:
Common phrases serve as a shortcut in communication, enabling us to convey complex ideas and emotions succinctly. For instance, when we say "actions speak louder than words," we express the notion that actions have more impact and credibility than mere promises or declarations. Such phrases condense a wealth of meaning into a few words, allowing us to express ourselves effectively and concisely. They provide a shared vocabulary that facilitates understanding and strengthens social bonds, reinforcing a sense of community.

Figurative Language:
Common phrases often employ figurative language to make a point or evoke a specific image or emotion. For instance, the phrase "the elephant in the room" refers to an obvious problem or issue that people avoid discussing. It paints a vivid mental picture and conveys the discomfort associated with unaddressed matters. Figurative language in common phrases adds depth and color to our communication, making it more engaging, memorable, and impactful.

Evolution of Meaning:
Over time, the meaning of common phrases can evolve or be adapted to suit the changing dynamics of society. For example, the phrase "cool as a cucumber" originally referred to a cucumber's coolness and calmness, but now it implies someone who remains calm and composed in stressful situations. This evolution demonstrates the malleability of language and its ability to adapt to new contexts, reflecting the evolving nature of human experiences.

Conclusion:

Common phrases hold a special place in our language and culture. They capture the collective wisdom, values, and experiences of societies across the globe. Through their origins, cultural significance, communicative efficiency, figurative language, and evolving meanings, common phrases continue to shape our everyday conversations. They act as linguistic bridges, fostering connection and understanding between individuals, communities, and generations

Headline: Federal Investigation Uncovers Massive Money Laundering Scheme

New York City, May 10, 2023 (AP) – In a major breakthrough, a federal investigation has uncovered a sprawling money laundering scheme with far-reaching implications. Law enforcement agencies, in collaboration with international counterparts, have been working tirelessly to dismantle the elaborate criminal network behind the operation.

The investigation, led by the United States Department of Justice, revealed that the money laundering scheme involved a web of offshore accounts, shell companies, and complex financial transactions. The perpetrators, whose identities have not been disclosed, allegedly utilized these mechanisms to launder illicit funds on an enormous scale.

Authorities estimate that billions of dollars were funneled through the network, involving multiple countries and spanning various industries. The operation employed sophisticated techniques to obscure the origins of the funds, making it a significant challenge for investigators to trace and dismantle.

The Department of Justice, in conjunction with other law enforcement agencies, has made several arrests and executed search warrants in connection with the case. Additional arrests are expected as the investigation continues to unfold.

This discovery serves as a stark reminder of the pervasive nature of financial crimes and the need for robust international cooperation in combating money laundering. Law enforcement agencies are collaborating closely with financial institutions and regulatory bodies to enhance transparency and strengthen anti-money laundering measures.

The case highlights the ongoing efforts to safeguard the integrity of the global financial system and protect it from illicit activities. Authorities are committed to prosecuting those responsible for these crimes to the fullest extent of the law and recovering any ill-gotten gains.

Further details regarding the individuals involved and the extent of the money laundering operation are expected to be disclosed in the coming weeks as the investigation progresses.

On auscultation, the lungs were clear bilaterally. Cardiac examination revealed regular rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdomen was soft and non-tender.

Diagnostic Evaluation:
Upon admission to the ER, the following tests were ordered:

1. Electrocardiogram (ECG): Showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an inferior wall myocardial infarction.

2. Cardiac enzymes: Troponin I levels were elevated, indicating myocardial damage.

3. Chest X-ray: No acute abnormalities noted.

Assessment:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation, elevated cardiac enzymes, and ECG findings, the initial diagnosis is an acute myocardial infarction, specifically involving the inferior wall of the heart.

Plan:
The patient was promptly started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%. Intravenous access was established, and he was given aspirin and nitroglycerin for symptom relief. Sublingual nitroglycerin was administered with subsequent improvement in chest pain. An order was placed for urgent coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if appropriate.

The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring. His blood pressure was managed with antihypertensive medication, and he was started on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). He was also given heparin to prevent clot formation.

The patient's family was notified about the situation, and they arrived at the hospital to provide support. The medical team explained the diagnosis, treatment plan, and the potential need for PCI. The patient was encouraged to make lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adherence to medications.

The case was discussed with the interventional cardiology team, who planned to perform coronary angiography and evaluate the suitability for PCI within the next 24 hours.

Ongoing monitoring and close observation were implemented to ensure early detection

Title: The Urgent Need for Climate Action: A Call to Save Our Planet

Introduction:

Climate change is an issue that has gripped the world with its dire consequences. As an 11th grader concerned about our future, it is crucial to understand the impacts of climate change and the urgent need for immediate action. With rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events becoming the new norm, we must take responsibility for the well-being of our planet and future generations.

Body:

1. The Science Behind Climate Change:

Let's start by understanding the science behind climate change. Our planet's atmosphere is composed of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating the natural greenhouse effect that keeps Earth warm enough for life. However, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased GHG concentrations in the atmosphere, causing an enhanced greenhouse effect. This, in turn, leads to global warming and climate change.

2. The Impacts of Climate Change:

The impacts of climate change are far-reaching and affect various aspects of our lives. Rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps, leading to a rise in sea levels. This not only endangers coastal communities but also threatens biodiversity and the delicate balance of ecosystems. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.

3. Environmental Justice and Climate Change:

Climate change exacerbates existing social inequalities. Vulnerable communities, including low-income neighborhoods and marginalized groups, often bear the brunt of its consequences. Environmental justice is a crucial aspect of climate action. As an 11th grader, it is our responsibility to raise awareness about the disproportionate impacts on these communities and advocate for equitable solutions.

4. The Role of Renewable Energy:

Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is essential to combat climate change. Renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, produces fewer GHG emissions and offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. By advocating for renewable energy policies and supporting the development of clean technologies, we can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.

5. Individual Actions Matter:

While systemic change is crucial, individual actions also play a significant role. As 11th graders, we can make conscious choices in our daily lives to reduce our carbon footprint. Simple steps like conserving energy, reducing waste, and adopting sustainable transportation options can collectively make a substantial impact.

6. The Importance of Education and Awareness:

Education and awareness are key to fostering a collective understanding of climate change and its implications. As students, we can engage in environmental clubs, organize awareness campaigns, and advocate for climate education in schools. By empowering ourselves with knowledge, we become catalysts for change and inspire others to take action.

Conclusion:

Climate change poses an imminent threat to our planet, and as 11th graders, we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to this crisis. We have a responsibility to raise our voices, take action, and demand change from policymakers and leaders. By understanding the science behind climate change, promoting environmental justice, supporting renewable energy, and making sustainable choices in our daily lives, we can collectively work towards a greener, more sustainable future. The time for action is now, and it is up to us, the young generation, to lead the charge and save our planet for generations to come.

Abstract Finnish is a language with multiple dialects that not only differ from each other in terms of accent (pronunciation) but also in terms of morphological forms and lexical choice. We present the first approach to automatically de- tect the dialect of a speaker based on a dialect transcript and transcript with audio recording in a dataset consisting of 23 different dialects. Our results show that the best accuracy is re- ceived by combining both of the modalities, as text only reaches to an overall accuracy of 57%, where as text and audio reach to 85%. Our code, models and data have been released openly on Github and Zenodo. Introduction We present an approach for identifying the dialect of a speaker automatically solely based on text and on audio and text together. We compare the uni- modal approach to the bimodal one. There are no previous dialect identification approaches for Finnish. There are several situations were a dialect identification method can be of use. For example, if we have ASR models fine tuned for specific di- alects, the dialect identification from audio could be used as a preprocessing step. The model could also be used to label recorded materials automatically in order to create archival metadata. In order to make our contribution useful for others, we have released our code, models and processed data openly on GitHub1 and Zenodo2. Finnish is a large Uralic language that is one of the official languages of Finland, and is used essen- tially at all levels of the modern society. There are approximately five million Finnish speakers. The language belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family, and is very closely related to Kare- lian, MeaÃÂnkieli and Kveeni, and is also closely re- lated to the Estonian language. It is more distantly related to numerous Uralic languages spoken in Russia. The history of written Finnish starts in the 16th century. Current orthography is connected to this written tradition, which developed into the current form in the late 19th century with a conscious plan- ning and systematic development of the lexicon. After this, the changes have been minor (HaÃÂkkinen, 1994, 16), and also impacted lexicon, especially what it comes to the development of the vocabu- lary of the modern society and traditional agrarian terminology becoming less known. The Finnish spoken language, however, is still largely based on Finnish dialects. In the 20th cen- tury some of the strongest dialectal features have been disappearing, but there are still clearly dis- tinguishable spoken vernacular varieties that are regionally marked. It has been shown that instead of clear disappearance of dialects there are vari- ous features that are spreading, but not at uniform rate, and reportedly younger speakers use the are- ally marked features less than the older speakers (Lappalainen, 2001, 92). Finnish vernaculars also represent historically rather different Finnic vari- eties, with major split between Eastern and Western dialects. There are, however, also dialect continu- ums and traditionally found gradual differentiation from region to region. Many of the changes have been lexical due to technical innovations and modernization of the society: orthographic spelling conventions have largely remained the same. Spoken Finnish, on the other hand, traditionally represents an areally di- vided dialect continuum, with several sharp bound- aries, and many regions of gradual differentiation from one municipality to another municipality. As mentioned, in the later parts of the 20th cen- tury relatively strong dialect leveling has been tak- ing place. Some of the Finnish dialects may already be concerned endangered, although the complex re- lationship between contemporary vernaculars and the most traditional dialectal forms makes this hard to ascertain. Dialect leveling in itself is a process known from many parts of Europe (Auer, 2018). However, in the case of Finnish the written stan- dard has remained relatively far from the spoken Finnish, besides individual narrow domains such as news broadcasts were the written form is used also in speech. Additionally there have been distinct text col- lections that include materials from this dialect archive. These include dialect books specific regions and municipalities, such as Oulun mur- rekirja [Dialect Book of Oulu] (PaÃÂaÃÂkkoÃÂnen, 1994) or Savonlinnan seudun murrekirja [Dialect book of Savonlinna region] (Palander, 1986). There have also been more recent larger collections that contains excerpts from essentiallydialects (LyytikaÃÂÃÂinen et al., 2013). Especially in the later parts of 21th century the spoken varieties have been leveling away from very specific local dialects, and although regional vari- eties still exist, most of the local varieties have certainly became endangered. Similar processes of dialect convergence have been reported from dif- ferent regions in Europe, although with substantial variation (Auer, 2018). In the case of Finnish this has not, however, resulted in merging of the written and spoken standards, but the spoken Finnish has remained, to our day, very distinct from the written standard. In a late 1950s, a program was set up to document extant spoken dialects, with the goal of recording 30 hours of speech from each municipal- ity. This work resulted in very large collections of dialectal recordings (LyytikaÃÂinen, 1984, 448-449). Many of these have been published, and some por- tion has also been manually normalized. Dataset used is described in more detail in Section 3 Data. In Finnish linguistics the dialect identification has primarily been studied in the context of folk linguistics. In this line of research the perceptions of native speakers are investigated (Niedzielski and Preston, 2000). This type of studies have been done for Finnish, for example, by MielikaÃÂinen and Palander (2014), RaÃÂsaÃÂnen and Palander (2015) and Palander (2011). It has been possible to suggest for individual dialects which features are the most stable and will remain as local regional markers, and which seem to be in retention (RaÃÂsaÃÂnen and Palander, 2015, 25). In this study we conduct just individual experiments and report their results, but in the further research we hope the results could be analyzed in more detail in connection with the earlier dialect perception studies, as we believe the differences in perceived dialect differences could be compared to the difficulties and successes the model has to differentiate individual varieties. Related work The current approaches to Finnish dialect have fo- cused on the textual modality only. Previously, bi- directional LSTM (long short-term memory) based models have been used to normalize Finnish di- alects to standard Finnish (Partanen et al., 2019) and to adapt standard Finnish text into different dialectal forms (HaÃÂmaÃÂlaÃÂinen et al., 2020). Similar approach has also been used to normalize historical Finnish (HaÃÂmaÃÂlaÃÂinen et al., 2021; Partanen et al., 2021). The closest research to our paper conducted for Finnish has been detection of foreign accents from audio. Behravan et al. (2013) have detected for- eign accents from audio only by using i-vectors. However, foreign accent detection is a very differ- ent task to native speaker dialect detection. Many foreign accents have clear cues through phonemes that are not part of the Finnish phonotactic system, where as with dialects, all phonemes are part of Finnish. There have been several recent approaches for Arabic to detect dialect from text (Balaji et al., 2020; Talafha et al., 2020; Alrifai et al., 2021). Textual dialect detection has been done also for German (Jauhiainen et al., 2018), Romanian (Za- haria et al., 2021) and Low Saxon (Siewert et al., 2020). The methods used range from traditional machine learning with features such as n-grams to neural models with pretrained embeddings, as it is typically the case in NLP research. None of these approaches use audio, as they rely on text only. At the same time, North Sami dialects have been identified from audio by training several models, kNNs, SVMs, RFs, CRFs, and LSTM, based on ex- tracted features (Kakouros et al., 2020). Kethireddy et al. (2020) use Mel-weighted SFF spectrogram to detect spoken Arabic dialects. Mel spectograms are also used by Draghici et al. (2020). All these approaches are mono-modal and use only audio. Based on our literature review, the existing ap- proaches use either text or audio for dialect detec- tion. We, however, use both modalities and apply them on a language with no existing dialect detec- tion models. Conclusions We have presented the first model for Finnish di- alect classification for a relatively large number of different dialects, 23 in total. Based on our ex- periments,text only model is not as effective in dialect classification as a model with text and audio. It is clear that the amount of data alone is not the only variable that constitutes a high performance of the model for a given dialect, but also how dis- tinctive a given dialect is from other dialects. Text and audio create interesting dialect vari- eties because they are the modalities for identifying dialects automatically solely based on text and on audio and text together. We present the first approach to automatically de- tect the dialect of a speaker based on a dialect transcript and transcript with audio recording in a dataset consisting of 23 different dialects. Our results show that the best accuracy is re- ceived by combining both of the modalities, as text only reaches to an overall accuracy of 57%, where as text and audio reach to 85%. Our code, models and data have been released openly on Github and Zenodo. Introduction We present an approach for identifying the dialect of a speaker automatically solely based on text and on audio and text together. We compare the uni- modal approach to the bimodal one. There are no previous dialect identification approaches for Finnish.

Abstract Across many data domains, co-occurrence statis- tics about the joint appearance of objects are powerfully informative. By transforming unsu- pervised learning problems into decompositions of co-occurrence statistics, spectral algorithms provide transparent and efficient algorithms for posterior inference such as latent topic analysis and community detection. As object vocabularies grow, however, it becomes rapidly more expensive to store and run inference algorithms on co-occur- rence statistics. Rectifying co-occurrence, the key process to uphold model assumptions, becomes increasingly more vital in the presence of rare terms, but current techniques cannot scale to large vocabularies. We propose novel methods that si- multaneously compress and rectify co-occurrence statistics, scaling gracefully with the size of vo- cabulary and the dimension of latent space. We also present new algorithms learning latent vari- ables from the compressed statistics, and verify that our methods perform comparably to previous approaches on both textual and non-textual data. Introduction Understanding the underlying geometry of noisy and com- plex data is a fundamental problem of unsupervised learning. Probabilistic models explain data generation processes in terms of low-dimensional latent variables. Inferring a poste- rior distribution for these latent variables provides us with a compact representation for various exploratory analyses and downstream tasks (Bengio et al., 2013). However, exact inference is often intractable due to entangled interactions between the latent variables (Blei et al., 2003; Airoldi et al., 2008; A. Erosheva, 2003; Pritchard et al., 2000). Variational inference transforms the posterior approximation into an optimization problem over simpler distributions with in- dependent parameters (Jordan et al., 1999; Wainwright & Jordan, 2008; Blei et al., 2017), while Markov Chain Monte Carlo enables users to sample from the desired posterior distribution (Neal, 1993; Neal et al., 2011; Robert & Casella, 2013). However, these likelihood-based methods require numerous iterations without any guarantee beyond local improvement at each step (Kulesza et al., 2014). When the data consists of collections of discrete objects, co-occurrence statistics summarize interactions between objects. Collaborative filtering learns low-dimensional rep- resentations of individual items, which are useful for recom- mendation systems, by explicitly decomposing the co-oc- currence of items that are jointly consumed by certain users (Lee et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2016). Word-vector mod- els learn low-dimensional embeddings of individual words, which encode useful linguistic biases for neural networks, by implicitly decomposing the co-occurrence of words that appear together in contexts (Pennington et al., 2014; Levy & Goldberg, 2014). If co-occurrence provides a rich enough set of unbiased moments about an underlying generative model, spectral methods can provably learn posterior con- figurations from co-occurrence information alone, without iterating through individual training examples (Arora et al., 2013; Anandkumar et al., 2012c; Hsu et al., 2012; Anand- kumar et al., 2012b). However, two major limitations hinder users from taking advantage of spectral inference based on co-occurrence. First, the second-order co-occurrence matrix already grows quadratically in the number of words (e.g. objects, items, products). Pruning the vocabulary is an option, but for a retailer selling millions of long-tailed products, learning representations of only a subset of the products is inade- quate. Second, inference quality is poor in real data that does not necessarily follow our generative model. Whereas likelihood-based methods (Blei et al., 2003; Airoldi et al., 2008; A. Erosheva, 2003; Pritchard et al., 2000) have an intrinsic capability to fit the data to the model despite their mismatch, sample noise can easily destroy the performance of spectral methods even if the data is synthesized from the model (Kulesza et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015). Rectification, a process of projecting empirical co-occur- rence onto a manifold consistent with the posterior geometry of the model, provides a principled treatment that improves the performance of spectral inference in the face of model- data mismatch (Lee et al., 2015). Alternating Projection rectification (AP) has been used to rectify the input co- occurrence matrix to the Anchor Word algorithm (AW), a second-order spectral topic model (Leeal., 2015; 2017; 2019), but running multiple projections dominates overall inference cost even when the vocabulary is small. AP makes the co-occurrence dense as well, exacerbating storage costs when operating on large vocabularies. In this paper, we propose two efficient methods that si- multaneously compress and rectify the co-occurrence ma- trix, scaling gracefully with the size of vo- cabulary and the dimension of latent space. We also propose a new approach that learns posterior con- figurations from the compressed statistics, enabling users to better interpret noisy and com- plex data even if the data is synthesized from the compressed statistics. Our experiments show that applying the p- ulary algorithm on a corpus of jade-white words grows the size of a football field even when the words are synthesized from the compressed statistics, rendering the data useless for neural networks. We also present new algorithms learning latent vari- ables from the compressed statistics, and verify that our methods perform comparably to previous approaches on both textual and non-textual data.

Subject: Promoting Sustainable Tourism for a Greener Future

Dear Editor,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my concern about the environmental impact of tourism and to advocate for promoting sustainable practices in the travel industry.

Tourism plays a significant role in the economic growth of our region, attracting visitors from all around the world to experience the beauty and cultural richness of our destinations. However, it is crucial that we address the environmental challenges associated with this industry.

Firstly, I believe that it is essential to focus on sustainable transportation options for travelers. Encouraging the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking can help reduce carbon emissions and alleviate traffic congestion in popular tourist areas. Furthermore, investing in efficient and eco-friendly public transport systems will not only benefit the environment but also enhance the overall travel experience for visitors.

Secondly, preserving natural resources should be a priority. Our pristine beaches, national parks, and wildlife habitats are valuable assets that need protection. Initiatives such as beach clean-ups, responsible waste management, and educating tourists about the importance of preserving our natural environment can go a long way in ensuring that these areas remain unspoiled for generations to come.

Thirdly, supporting local businesses and communities is crucial for sustainable tourism. Encouraging travelers to choose locally owned accommodations, restaurants, and souvenir shops not only contributes to the local economy but also promotes cultural exchange and fosters a deeper connection between visitors and the destination.

In addition, collaboration between the government, tourism industry, and environmental organizations is vital to implement and monitor sustainable tourism practices. This collaboration can help establish guidelines and certifications for eco-friendly accommodations, promote sustainable tour operators, and raise awareness among travelers about their role in preserving the environment.

Lastly, educating tourists about responsible travel practices is essential. By providing information on how to minimize their ecological footprint, respect local cultures and traditions, and support conservation efforts, we can empower visitors to make informed choices that benefit both the environment and the local communities.

As a community, we have a responsibility to protect and preserve the natural wonders that make our region so attractive to travelers. By embracing sustainable tourism practices, we can create a greener and more sustainable future for our beloved destinations.

I urge local authorities, tourism boards, and stakeholders to collaborate on developing and implementing sustainable tourism strategies. Together, we can ensure that our region continues to thrive while safeguarding the environment for future generations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that our community can come together and make a positive difference in promoting sustainable tourism practices.

Abstract Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelli- gence that gives machines the ability to decode human languages. Part- of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is a pre-processing task that requires an annotated corpus. Rule-based and stochastic methods showed remarkable results for POS tag prediction. On this work, I performed a mathematical model based on Hidden Markov structures and I obtained a high-level ac- curacy of ingredients extracted from text recipe with performances greater than what traditional methods could make without unknown words con- sideration. Introduction Artificial intelligence had shown a great progress in the recent years especially the deep learning branch where learning techniques have been improved very quickly. The combination of representation learning and deep learning have allowed the emerging of a new AI class called deep reinforcement learning. Deep Reinforcement learning tend to estimate value functions from exper- iments and simulations and using dynamic programming through Deep Re- inforcement learning is an efficient way to build reactive strategies acting on instantaneous control. An algorithm which approves its performance by experi- ence is an algorithm capable of avoiding his own mistakes through a combination of a strong memory fed by fresh helpful data and the ability to keep winning pre- dictions after a long-term performance (Barto, Bradtke, & Singh, 1995) (Mnih et al., 2015). Neural Network can be considered as a dynamic Reinforcement Learning scheme where the layers are putted in a parallel way to have a cascaded trans- mission of the treated signal (Fukushima & Miyake, 1982) (LeCun et al., 1989) and where a prior knowledge is important to predict the output state of new observations. Sequential modeling is a way to process data in natural language processing by maximizing awards after manipulating situation and producing resulting actions (Vithayathil Varghese & Mahmoud, 2020) (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015). A sequential model representation is influenced by its data representation and how tensors are trained to produce an optimal control (Bengio, Courville, & Vincent, 2013) To improve the target learning task, transfer learning is used as a powerful technique to increase the value of the most probable cases inside a state matrix (Boutsioukis, Partalas, & Vlahavas, 2011). Transferring the knowledge helps us to reduce the amount of data consumed and rely on feature engineering to reduce the noise caused by annotation errors and other tag-set anomalies in a context of multi-agent system. Extracting ingredients automatically from a recipe text is an extremely use- ful activity especially when we want to analyze a massive data of text recipes. Rule-Based methods were implemented to extract information from unstruc- tured recipe data (Silva, Ribeiro, & Ferreira, 2019) Ingredients is not the only useful information we want to extract; in this work we are going to use Hidden Markov Models especially Viterbi algorithm with some modification to make it receiving two unique features: POS-tags and tokens, to predict ingredient states. Previous works Many previous works were interested in analyzing cuisine recipes, for exam- ple Sina Sajadmanesh (Sajadmanesh et al., 2017) presented an analysis of the ingredients diversity around the word using an ingredient-based classifier to dif- ferentiate between recipes around the word based on its geographical identity. Sina Sajadmanesh (Sajadmanesh et al., 2017) studied the diversity of ingredi- ents in dishes with introduction of global diversity (the ability to have diversified ingredients between recipes) and local diversity (the ability to have diversified ingredients within a recipe). Other related work for culinary habits is Yong-Yeol Ahn paper (Ahn, Ahnert, Bagrow, & Barab ÃÂasi, 2011) who introduced the notion of Flavor Network and tried to verify the Food Paring hypothesis introduced on the 90Ã¢ÂÂs by Heston Blumenthal and Francois Benzi. Flavor network as described by Ahn is a graph where the nodes are the ingredients extracted from recipes and weights are shared flavors between nodes. Food paring hypothesis is an indicator calculated after forming the Flavor Network to show if in a country or in a geographical part of the word we have tasty recipes or the ingredients do not have similar molecules. Tiago Simas (Simas, Ficek, Diaz-Guilera, Obrador, & Rodriguez, 2017) introduced the notion of food bridging formed with semi-metric distances. A group of scientists in a recent publication (Van Erp et al., 2021)oped a state of the art of the use of artificial intelligence and natural language processing in analyzing food recipes. In this article we can found collected ref- erences talking about the challenging part in collecting food and recipe data. For example, Ahnert (Ahnert, 2013) presented the emergence of computational gastronomy in food science and its effect on culinary practices.

I agree with (Van Erp et al., 2021) concerning how challenging to use IA in food domain and how it will resolve issues concerning the creation of a data driven analysis of nutrition. In our paper data extracted can be used in a phone application or a recommended system for people who want to take care of their health. All previously cited researches on cuisine recipes need information extrac- tion from text recipe to use it on graphical visualization and statistical analysis. Information extraction can be used manually by extracting ingredients indi- cated on recipes or automatically. The problem in automatic extraction is that information should be precise to have also precise analysis, for example some ingredients take only one word and others can take two or three words. Another problem on automatic information extraction is that some ingredients that take one word have in common some words with other ingredients that have more than one word which make automatic information extraction more difficult.

Abstract We provide a hands-on introduction to optimized textual sentiment indexation using the R package sentometrics. Textual sentiment analysis is increasingly used to unlock the potential information value of textual data. The sentometrics package implements an intuitive framework to efficiently compute sentiment scores of numerous texts, to aggregate the scores into multiple time series, and to use these time series to predict other variables. The workflow of the package is illustrated with a built-in corpus of news articles from two major U.S. journals to forecast the CBOE Volatility Index. Keywords: Aggregation, Penalized Regression, Prediction, R, sentometrics, Textual Senti- ment, Time Series. Introduction Individuals, companies, and governments continuously consume written material from various sources to improve their decisions. The corpus of texts is typically of a high-dimensional longitudinal nature requiring statistical tools to extract the relevant information. A key source of information is the sentiment transmitted through texts, called textual sentiment. Algaba, Ardia, Bluteau, Borms, and Boudt (2020) review the notion of sentiment and its applications, mainly in economics and finance. They define sentiment as Ã¢ÂÂthe disposition of an entity towards an entity, expressed via a certain medium.Ã¢ÂÂ The medium in this case is texts. The sentiment expressed through texts may provide valuable insights on the future dynamics of variables related to firms, the economy, political agendas, product satisfaction, and marketing campaigns, for instance. Still, textual sentiment does not live by the premise to be equally useful across all applications. Deciphering when, to what degree, and which layers of the sentiment add value is needed to consistently study the full information potential present within qualitative communications. The econometric approach of constructing time series of sentiment by means of optimized selection and weighting of textual sentiment is referred to as sentometrics by Algaba et al. (2020) and Ardia, Bluteau, and Boudt (2019). The term sentometrics is a composition of (textual) sentiment analysis and (time series) econometrics. The release of the R (R Core Team 2021) text mining infrastructure tm (Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer 2008) over a decade ago can be considered the starting point of the development and popularization of textual analysis tools in R. A number of successful follow-up attempts at improving the speed and interface of the comprehensive natural language processing capabil- ities provided by tm have been delivered by the packages openNLP (Hornik 2019), cleanNLP (Arnold 2017), quanteda (Benoit, Watanabe, Wang, Nulty, Obeng, MuÃÂller, and Matsuo 2018), tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2016), and qdap (Rinker 2020). The notable tailor-made packages for sentiment analysis in R are meanr (Schmidt 2019), SentimentAnalysis (Feuerriegel and Proellochs 2021), sentimentr (Rinker 2019b), and syuzhet (Jockers 2020). Many of these packages rely on one of the larger above-mentioned textual analysis infrastructures. The meanr package computes net sentiment scores fastest, but offers no flexibility.1 The SentimentAnalysis package relies on a similar calculation as used in tmÃ¢ÂÂs sentiment scoring function. The package can additionally be used to generate and evaluate sentiment dictionaries. The sentimentr package extends the polarity scoring function from the qdap package to handle more difficult linguistic edge cases, but is therefore slower than packages which do not attempt this. The SentimentAnalysis and syuzhet packages also become comparatively slower for large input corpora. The quanteda and tidytext packages have no explicit sentiment computation function but their toolsets can be used to construct one. Our R package sentometrics proposes a well-defined modeling workflow, specifically targeted at studying the evolution of textual sentiment and its impact on other quantities. It can be used (i) to compute textual sentiment, (ii) to aggregate fine-grained textual sentiment into various sentiment time series, and (iii) to predict other variables with these sentiment measures. The combination of these three facilities leads to a flexible and computationally efficient framework to exploit the information value of sentiment in texts. The package presented in this paper therefore addresses the present lack of analytical capability to extract time series intelligence about the sentiment transmitted through a large panel of texts. Furthermore, the sentometrics package positions itself as both integrative and supplementary to the powerful textand data science toolboxes in the R universe. It is integrative, as it combines the strengths of quanteda and stringi (Gagolewski 2021) for corpus construction and manipulation. It uses data.table (Dowle and Srinivasan 2021) for fast aggregation of textual sentiment into time series, and glmnet (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2010) and caret (Kuhn 2021) for (sparse) model estimation. The time series and time series packages also become available. The time series and time series packages also become available. The time series and time series packages also become available. The time series and time series packages also become available. The packages time series (Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer 2008) and time series (Gagolewski and Srinivasan 2021).

The Alchemist: A Journey of Self-Discovery

Hey, fellow bookworms! Today, I want to dive into the incredible world of "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. If you're into adventure, self-discovery, and a little bit of magic, this book is definitely for you. Strap in as we explore the life-changing journey of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy, and the valuable life lessons he learns along the way.

"The Alchemist" is set in the vibrant and mysterious land of Spain. Santiago, our young protagonist, starts off as an ordinary shepherd tending his sheep in the rolling hills of Andalusia. However, he's not content with his mundane life and dreams of finding hidden treasures and experiencing the wonders of the world. Who can't relate to that feeling of yearning for something more exciting?

As the story unfolds, Santiago meets an intriguing character, the King of Salem, who encourages him to follow his Personal Legend, a destiny that leads each person to their true purpose in life. This concept really struck a chord with me, as I often wonder what my own Personal Legend might be. Santiago's journey becomes an allegorical representation of our own quests for self-discovery.

Along his journey, Santiago encounters many fascinating individuals who teach him important life lessons. The crystal merchant, for example, teaches him about the danger of settling for mediocrity and the importance of pursuing one's dreams. This resonated with me because it's easy to fall into a routine and forget to pursue our passions. The crystal merchant's regret serves as a reminder to never let our dreams slip away.

One of the most impactful characters in the book is the alchemist himself. This wise and enigmatic figure becomes Santiago's mentor, guiding him through the desert and imparting invaluable wisdom. The alchemist teaches Santiago the importance of listening to one's heart and connecting with the Soul of the World. It's a profound message that reminds us to trust our instincts and have faith in the universe.

Coelho's writing style is simple yet powerful, making "The Alchemist" accessible and captivating for readers of all ages. His use of vivid imagery allows us to visualize the breathtaking landscapes Santiago encounters on his journey. From the vast Egyptian pyramids to the endless desert dunes, each description paints a picture in our minds that transports us right into the heart of the story.

What I found particularly inspiring about "The Alchemist" is its exploration of the theme of perseverance. Santiago faces numerous setbacks and challenges, but he never gives up on his dreams. This resonated with me as a high school student, as I often feel overwhelmed by the pressures of academics and future uncertainties. Santiago's unwavering determination encouraged me to keep pushing forward, no matter how tough the journey may be.

Another aspect of the book that I loved is the magical realism woven throughout the narrative. Coelho seamlessly blends elements of fantasy and spirituality with the realities of Santiago's journey. It's as if the magical moments serve as reminders that the universe is full of possibilities and that there's more to life than what meets the eye. This blend of realism and mysticism creates a sense of wonder and enchantment that keeps the reader engaged from start to finish.

In conclusion, "The Alchemist" is a captivating tale of self-discovery and following one's dreams. Through Santiago's journey, we learn valuable life lessons about perseverance, listening to our hearts, and embracing the magic of the world around us. Coelho's simple yet evocative writing style and the book's themes of personal growth make it a must-read for anyone seeking inspiration and a deeper understanding of their own journey in life. So grab a copy, embark on this transformative adventure, and discover your own Personal Legend. Happy reading!

Abstract This work explores the capacities of character- based Neural Machine Translation to translate noisy User-Generated Content (UGC) with a strong focus on exploring the limits of such ap- proaches to handle productive UGC phenom- ena, which almost by definition, cannot be seen at training time. Within a strict zero- shot scenario, we first study the detrimental impact on translation performance of various user-generated content phenomena on a small annotated dataset we developed, and then show that such models are indeed incapable of han- dling unknown letters, which leads to catastrophic translation failure once such characters are encountered. We further confirm this be- havior with a simple, yet insightful, copy task experiment and highlight the importance of reducing the vocabulary size hyper-parameter to increase the robustness of character-based models for machine translation. Introduction. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models fall far short from being able to translate noisy User- Generated Content (UGC): the quality of their translation is often even worse than that of a traditional phrase-based system (Khayrallah and Koehn, 2018; Rosales NuÃÂnÃÂez et al., 2019). In addi- tion to ambiguous grammatical constructs and pro- fusion of ellipsis, the main difficulty encountered when translating UGC is the high number of out- of-vocabulary tokens (OOVs) resulting from mis- spelled words, emoticons, hashtags, mentions, and all specific constructs used in online forums and social medias (Foster, 2010; Seddah et al., 2012; Eisenstein, 2013; Sanguinetti et al., 2020). Some of those phenomena can be perceived as noise while the others are typical markers of language variation among speakers. Moreover, a certain amount of those same phenomena operate at the lexical level (either at the character, subword or word levels) (Sanguinetti et al., 2020). This is why, focusing more on the noise axis, char-based mod- els appear to offer a natural solution to this prob- lem (Luong and Manning, 2016; Ling et al., 2015): indeed these open vocabulary models are designed specifically to address the OOV problem. In this work, we explore the ability of out-of- the-box character-based NMT models (Lee et al., 2017) to address the challenges raised by UGC translation. While character-based models may seem promising for such task, to the best of our knowledge, they have only been tested either on data sets in which noise has been artificially added through sampling an edited word error data set (Be- linkov and Bisk, 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2018a) and on canonical data set, in which they prove to be very effective for translating morphologically-rich languages with a high number of OOVs (Luong and Manning, 2016). However, our starting-points experiments show that character-based systems are outperformed by BPE models even when translating noisy UGC. To understand this counter-intuitive result, we con- duct several experiments and analyses. In partic- ular, we manually annotated 400 sentences at the token level using a fine-grained typology, to per- form our analyses. These sentences correspond to the worst and the best translated utterances of two MT systems (a char-based and a transformer-based model). Our results highlight the extreme sensi- bility of character-based models to the vocabulary size, a parameter often overlooked in the literature. Using a simple set of experiments, we thus show that these models are unable to perform an easy copy task due to their poor handling of unknown and rare characters. By adjusting the vocabulary size parameter, we drastically improve the robust- ness of our character-based model without causing a large drop in in-domain performance. Our contributions are as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we provide an annotated data set that enables in-depth evaluations of the impact of UGC idiosyncrasies; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we demonstrate that char-based neural machine translation models are extremely sensi- tive to unknown and rare characters on both synthetic data and noisy user-generated content; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we show how an overlooked hyper-parameter drastically improve char-based MT models ro- bustness to natural noise while maintaining the in-domain level of performance. Conclusion We showed that in zero-shot scenarios, char-based models are not robust to UGC idiosyncrasies. We presented several experiments that explained this counter-intuitive result by an over-sensibility of these models to the vocabulary size. We demonstrated that drastically lowering this param- eterthe robustness of our char-based models when facing noisy UGC while maintaining almost the same level of performance for in-domain and out-of-domain canonical datasets. Interestingly, we noticed a lack in the literature regarding the importance of vocabulary considerations when training character-based NMTmodels.

Singer Chris Brown was released from a Los Angeles County jail earlier today. The 27-year-old had been held for several weeks after admitting to a probation violation in May. Brown had been on probation for an assault charge from 2009. He was released early due to overcrowding in the jail. Despite being released from jail, Brown still faces charges in Washington, DC. He was charged with misdemeanor assault in October 2013 after allegedly punching a man outside a hotel. Brown's trial in Washington has been delayed several times, with the latest date set for a few weeks from now. Brown has been in and out of legal trouble since 2009. In addition to the assault charge, he's faced charges for vandalism, hit-and-run, and attacking his former girlfriend, Rihanna. He's also faced several civil lawsuits. Despite his legal issues, Brown has continued to release music, with his most recent album, Royalty, coming out in 2015.

Former U.S. Senator Harry Reid's wife, Landra, was involved in a car accident on Thursday. The accident left her with multiple injuries, including a broken neck, a vertebra, and her nose. Following surgery, she has regained some of her abilities and is expected to undergo physical therapy before being released from the hospital. According to the attending physician, Landra Reid has made significant progress since her surgery. \"She is able to get out of bed, and she's able to swallow some,\" the doctor said, adding that she can also move her arms and legs. Despite the positive news, the doctor emphasized that Mrs. Reid has a long recovery road ahead of her. The accident occurred on a quiet road in Virginia, according to authorities. Landra Reid was reportedly the only passenger in the car and was wearing her seatbelt at the time of the accident. There is no word yet on what caused the accident, and police are investigating. The Reid family released a statement thanking everyone for their support and asking for privacy during this difficult time. “We appreciate the overwhelming support and kindness shown to Landra and our family during the past few days. We ask that everyone continue to keep her in their thoughts and prayers as she recovers.” Landra Reid is a prominent figure in the political world and has been married to former Senator Harry Reid for more than fifty years. The couple has five children and several grandchildren. Landra has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform and worked closely with her husband during his time in Congress. The news of Landra's accident has generated an outpouring of support from politicians and the public alike. Many have taken to social media to express their concern and offer their thoughts and prayers to the Reid family. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who served as Reid's former chief of staff, released a statement expressing her deep concern for Landra's well-being. \"Landra Reid is one of the most gracious and caring people I've ever met,\" she said. \"My thoughts are with her and her family at this difficult time.\" Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also expressed her support for the Reid family on Twitter, writing, \"Bill and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to Harry Reid and his family, especially his wife Landra, as they deal with the aftermath of a serious accident. We are with you, and we are sending our love.\" As Landra Reid continues her recovery, the Reid family has asked for continued privacy and respect for their situation. The community continues to rally around the family, offering their support and well wishes during this difficult time.

Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture, suffered a major hit from a strong typhoon that pounded the island with intense winds and torrential rains, leaving behind a trail of destruction that disrupted the lives of over a hundred thousand people. The typhoon, dubbed Typhoon Maysak, made landfall on Okinawa Island early on Tuesday, September 1, causing severe damage to buildings, roads, and power infrastructure. According to a CNN iReporter, the wind was so loud that it was difficult to hear people in the same room. The typhoon brought winds of up to 260 kilometers per hour, which resulted in the loss of power for over 106,100 electric customers in Okinawa. In addition to the power outage, the typhoon also caused the suspension of transportation services, including flights, trains, and ferry services. Numerous schools, public facilities, and businesses were closed, with authorities warning residents to stay indoors and prepare for potential disasters, including floods and landslides. While Typhoon Maysak's power over Okinawa has decreased, meteorologists warn that the typhoon could still pose a significant threat to the Kyushu region, which is still reeling from the flooding caused by Typhoon Haishen earlier this week. Kyushu has already endured severe damage from the ongoing heavy rains that have triggered floods, mudslides, and evacuations in the region. The authorities are concerned that Maysak's heavy rains could lead to further damage and pose a risk to human lives. In preparation for the oncoming storm, Kyushu Electric Power, one of Japan's largest utility companies, has taken measures to ensure that their systems are prepared for the worst-case scenario. The company has dispatched crews to monitor the condition of power lines and transformers to prevent widespread power outages. Local governments also advised residents in the affected areas to take precautions, such as stocking up on emergency supplies and securing their homes. Moreover, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has issued an emergency warning to the Kyushu region, where Maysak is expected to hit hardest. The agency warned that the powerful typhoon could bring heavy rainfall totaling up to 400 millimeters in some areas, and coastal areas could see waves as high as fifteen meters. JMA urges residents to keep informed and be prepared to take action if necessary. As Japan prepares to face another natural disaster, the government is working to protect the safety of its citizens. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has instructed government officials to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of people in Okinawa and Kyushu. The country's Self-Defense Forces and the Coast Guard are on standby to provide assistance in case of emergencies. The government has also urged the public to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to stay safe. In conclusion, Typhoon Maysak has already wreaked havoc in Okinawa, causing significant damage and disruption to daily life. While the typhoon has considerably weakened, the impact on Kyushu remains unsure. The Japanese government is working to minimize the damages and hazards that the typhoon could bring. It is highly advisable for the residents in the affected areas to take precautions and follow the instructions provided by the authorities to keep themselves and their families safe.
